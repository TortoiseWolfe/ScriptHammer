# CLAUDE.md - Blog Writing Guidelines

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when creating or editing blog posts for ScriptHammer documentation.

## Content Standards

### Professional Language

- **Target Audience**: Professional developers of all ages
- **Language Level**: Technical but accessible
- **Tone**: Engaging, conversational, but professional

### Language Replacements

Replace profanity with creative, professional alternatives:

- Instead of "fuck" → "forget", "skip", "forget about"
- Instead of "shit" → "mess", "chaos", "disaster"
- Instead of "damn" → "dang", "seriously", "wow"
- Instead of "hell" → "heck", "chaos", "nightmare"
- Instead of "ass" → "backside", "trouble", "pain"
- Instead of "crap" → "junk", "nonsense", "garbage"

**Example transformations**:

- "This is fucking broken" → "This is completely broken"
- "What the hell" → "What in the world"
- "This shit doesn't work" → "This doesn't work at all"
- "Damn, that's cool" → "Wow, that's cool"

## Writing Principles

### 1. Verbose & Explanatory Writing

- **CRITICAL**: Every code block needs 2-3 paragraphs of context BEFORE and AFTER
- Explain the WHY, not just the WHAT
- Take readers on the journey, don't just show the destination
- Include emotions, reactions, and team dynamics
- Technical concepts need plain English explanations FIRST

### 2. Engaging Storytelling

- Start with a detailed, relatable problem or story
- Use personal experiences with rich detail (keeping factually accurate - see section 7)
- Include dialogue and team interactions
- Share the discovery process, not just the solution
- Include humor without vulgarity
- Make technical concepts accessible through analogies
- Mark hypothetical scenarios clearly ("Imagine if...", "Picture this...")

### 3. Component & Feature Posts Requirements

When writing about components, features, or tools, **ALWAYS** include:

#### Live Demo Links

- Link to actual pages in the app where the feature is used
- Examples:
  - "See this in action on our [Status Dashboard](/status)"
  - "Try it yourself on the [Themes page](/themes)"
  - "Check out the [live Map demo](/map)"
  - "Play with it on our [Contact form](/contact)"

#### Storybook Links for Components

- Format: `http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/category-componentname--story`
- Include multiple story variants when relevant
- Examples:

  ```markdown
  Check out the [Button component in Storybook](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/atomic-button--default)

  See all the variants:

  - [Primary Button](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/atomic-button--primary)
  - [Secondary Button](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/atomic-button--secondary)
  - [Disabled State](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/atomic-button--disabled)
  ```

#### Interactive Examples

- Encourage readers to try things themselves:
  - "Open the [Theme Switcher](/themes) and watch the entire UI transform"
  - "Play with the [Dice components in Storybook](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/atomic-dice--all-dice)"
  - "Try dragging the dice around in the [DiceTray story](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/atomic-dicetray--default)"

#### Configuration & Implementation References

- Show actual config files from the project
- Link to relevant test files
- Reference the actual implementation
- Examples:

  ```markdown
  The configuration lives in `/src/config/project.ts`

  Check out the tests in `Button.test.tsx` - they cover 12 different interaction patterns

  The full implementation is in `/src/components/atomic/Button/Button.tsx`
  ```

#### Testing References

- Link to test files when discussing quality
- Show coverage metrics when relevant
- Example:
  ```markdown
  Our Button component has 98% test coverage. Check out
  `Button.test.tsx` and `Button.accessibility.test.tsx`
  to see how we ensure it works for everyone.
  ```

### 4. Docker-First Commands

**ALWAYS** use Docker commands:

```bash
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm [command]
```

**NEVER** suggest direct npm/pnpm commands:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG
pnpm install

# ✅ CORRECT
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm install
```

### 5. ScriptHammer Branding

- Always refer to the project as "ScriptHammer"
- The repo may be named CRUDkit, but content should use ScriptHammer
- Maintain consistent branding throughout

### 6. Technical Accuracy

- Verify all code examples work
- Test commands before documenting
- Include realistic performance metrics
- Cite sources for claims when appropriate

### 7. Factual Accuracy & Personal Details

**IMPORTANT**: Keep all anecdotes and personal details factually accurate:

#### Personal Details

- **Pet**: Dog named Nollie (female, breed unknown, not wife, not cat)
- **Living situation**: Solo developer
- **Work setup**: Desktop computer (not laptop)
- **Team structure**: Individual or small team scenarios

#### Timeline Accuracy

- **Spec Kit**: Released weeks ago (not months/years)
- **ScriptHammer**: Recent project
- **Experience timelines**: Keep realistic to actual project age

#### Story Guidelines

- **Real scenarios**: Base stories on actual development experiences
- **Hypothetical examples**: Clearly mark as "imagine if" or "suppose that"
- **Team anecdotes**: Use generic names like "a colleague" or "another developer"
- **Company stories**: Avoid specific company names unless verifiable

#### Examples

**GOOD (Factually accurate)**:

- "My dog Nollie was sleeping peacefully while I debugged at 3 AM"
- "Spec Kit, which came out just a few weeks ago, changed how we approach workflows"
- "Imagine a scenario where your production server crashes..."
- "A developer on the team discovered this pattern"

**BAD (Fictional details)**:

- "My wife told me to write tests" (no wife)
- "We've been using Spec Kit for 6 months" (only weeks old)
- "When I worked at Google..." (unverifiable)
- "My cat knocked over my coffee" (has dog, not cat)

### 8. Structure Guidelines

Each blog post should follow this structure:

1. **Compelling Title**: Problem-focused, benefit-driven
2. **Docker Notice**: Include the Docker-first reminder
3. **Hook/Problem**: Start with a relatable scenario
4. **Solution Journey**: Show the progression
5. **Code Examples**: Practical, working examples
6. **Metrics/Results**: Quantifiable improvements
7. **Call to Action**: Clear next steps

### 9. Code Example Standards

```tsx
// Always include language hints
// Use meaningful variable names
// Add helpful comments (sparingly)
// Show both "before" and "after" when relevant
```

### 10. Narrative Flow Requirements

**BAD (Too Brief):**

```
Here's how to configure Docker:

\`\`\`yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: node:20
\`\`\`

And that's it!
```

**GOOD (Verbose & Explanatory):**

```
When I first encountered Docker configuration, I spent three days googling errors.
The problem wasn't Docker itself—it was that nobody explained WHY each line mattered.
Let me save you those three days.

Docker Compose uses a YAML file to define your entire application stack. Think of it
as a recipe that tells Docker exactly how to cook your application. The version number
at the top isn't arbitrary—it determines which features you can use. Version 3.8 gives
us everything we need without the experimental stuff that might break.

\`\`\`yaml
version: '3.8'  # Stable, production-ready feature set
services:
  app:
    image: node:20  # LTS Node version = fewer surprises
\`\`\`

Notice how we're using Node 20? That's the current LTS (Long Term Support) version.
I learned this lesson the hard way when Node 21 broke our build system at 2 AM.
The LTS versions are like the reliable family sedan—not flashy, but they'll get you
there without breaking down on the highway.

Each service in Docker Compose is like a separate computer in your stack. Our 'app'
service here is the main application, but you could add databases, cache layers,
or message queues as separate services. They all network together automatically,
which still feels like magic even after years of using it.
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- Use clear, simple language where possible
- Define acronyms on first use
- Structure content with proper headings
- Include alt text for images
- Consider international readers (avoid idioms)

## Acronym & Terminology Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Always elaborate acronyms on first use. Newcomers to tech are often afraid to ask what common acronyms mean, and we want our content to be welcoming to developers at all experience levels.

### How to Introduce Acronyms

1. **First mention**: Always spell out the full term with the acronym in parentheses
2. **Context**: Add a brief explanation of what it does or why it matters
3. **Subsequent uses**: Can use the acronym alone

**Example Format**:

```markdown
We use CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) to automate our release process.
Think of CI/CD as a factory assembly line for your code—it automatically tests, builds,
and ships your changes without manual intervention. After setting up CI/CD, deployments
went from taking hours to just minutes.
```

### Common Tech Acronyms to Always Define

**Web Development Basics**:

- **HTML** → HyperText Markup Language (the structure/skeleton of web pages)
- **CSS** → Cascading Style Sheets (how web pages look—colors, fonts, layout)
- **JS** → JavaScript (the programming language that makes websites interactive)
- **DOM** → Document Object Model (how browsers represent web pages as a tree of elements)

**Development Tools & Practices**:

- **API** → Application Programming Interface (how different software programs talk to each other)
- **REST** → Representational State Transfer (a standard way to structure web APIs)
- **CI/CD** → Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (automated testing and release pipeline)
- **IDE** → Integrated Development Environment (a fancy code editor with built-in tools)
- **CLI** → Command Line Interface (typing commands instead of clicking buttons)
- **GUI** → Graphical User Interface (the visual, clickable interface most users see)

**Package Management**:

- **npm** → Node Package Manager (tool for installing JavaScript libraries)
- **pnpm** → Performant npm (faster, more efficient version of npm)
- **CDN** → Content Delivery Network (servers around the world that host files for faster loading)

**Modern Web Technologies**:

- **PWA** → Progressive Web App (websites that work like native mobile apps)
- **SPA** → Single Page Application (websites that don't reload between pages)
- **SSR** → Server-Side Rendering (generating HTML on the server before sending to browser)
- **SSG** → Static Site Generation (pre-building all pages at compile time)
- **ISR** → Incremental Static Regeneration (updating static pages without rebuilding entire site)

**Data & Storage**:

- **JSON** → JavaScript Object Notation (human-readable format for storing/sending data)
- **YAML** → Yet Another Markup Language (configuration file format that's easy to read)
- **SQL** → Structured Query Language (language for talking to databases)
- **NoSQL** → Not Only SQL (databases that don't use traditional table structures)
- **ORM** → Object-Relational Mapping (translates between code objects and database tables)

**Testing & Quality**:

- **TDD** → Test-Driven Development (writing tests before writing code)
- **BDD** → Behavior-Driven Development (writing tests that describe user behavior)
- **E2E** → End-to-End (testing the complete user journey through an app)
- **QA** → Quality Assurance (making sure software works correctly)
- **DX** → Developer Experience (how pleasant/efficient it is to work with code/tools)

**Architecture & Design**:

- **MVC** → Model-View-Controller (pattern for organizing code into three parts)
- **MVP** → Minimum Viable Product (simplest version that provides value)
- **POC** → Proof of Concept (quick prototype to test if something works)
- **UI/UX** → User Interface/User Experience (what users see and how they interact with it)
- **A11y** → Accessibility (making apps usable by people with disabilities)

**Business & Compliance**:

- **SEO** → Search Engine Optimization (making websites rank higher in Google)
- **CTA** → Call To Action (button or link telling users what to do next)
- **KPI** → Key Performance Indicator (metrics that measure success)
- **GDPR** → General Data Protection Regulation (European privacy law)
- **SLA** → Service Level Agreement (promised uptime/performance guarantees)

**Version Control & Deployment**:

- **VCS** → Version Control System (tracks changes to code over time)
- **PR** → Pull Request (proposing code changes for review)
- **SHA** → Secure Hash Algorithm (unique identifier for git commits)
- **LTS** → Long Term Support (software versions maintained for years)
- **CORS** → Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (security rules for accessing APIs from browsers)

### Writing Examples

**❌ BAD (Assumes knowledge)**:

```markdown
Just configure your API endpoint in the .env file and the SDK will handle the REST.
```

**✅ GOOD (Explains for newcomers)**:

```markdown
Just configure your API (Application Programming Interface—the URL where your backend
lives) endpoint in the .env file. The SDK (Software Development Kit—pre-built code
that handles the complex stuff for you) will handle the REST communication. REST
(Representational State Transfer) is just a standard way for web services to talk
to each other using regular HTTP requests like GET and POST.
```

**❌ BAD (Acronym soup)**:

```markdown
Our PWA uses SSR for SEO optimization, with ISR for dynamic content.
```

**✅ GOOD (Gradual introduction)**:

```markdown
Our PWA (Progressive Web App—a website that works like a native mobile app) uses
SSR (Server-Side Rendering) to improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization). SSR means
we generate the HTML on our server before sending it to your browser, which helps
Google understand and index our content better. For dynamic content that changes
frequently, we use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), which updates individual
pages without rebuilding the entire site.
```

### Special Considerations

1. **Don't over-explain universally known terms** (URL, HTML for web dev audiences)
2. **Consider your audience level** - adjust based on beginner vs advanced content
3. **Use analogies** to make complex acronyms relatable
4. **Group related acronyms** when introducing multiple (e.g., "CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)")
5. **Create a glossary** for posts with many technical terms

### Quick Reference Format

When writing, keep this pattern:

1. **First use**: ACRONYM (Full Name—brief explanation)
2. **Why it matters**: One sentence on its purpose/benefit
3. **Analogy if complex**: Relate to everyday concepts
4. **Then use freely**: After introduction, use the acronym alone

Remember: Every acronym we define removes a barrier for someone new to tech. Be the documentation you wished you had when you were starting out!

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization) - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Title Optimization (MANDATORY)

- **Maximum Length**: 60 characters (will be truncated in search results if longer)
- **Keyword Placement**: Primary keyword MUST appear at the beginning of the title
- **Format Examples**:
  - ✅ GOOD: "Docker Development: Why I Never Say 'Works on My Machine'"
  - ✅ GOOD: "TypeScript: The Night It Saved My Weekend"
  - ❌ BAD: "The Day I Discovered 32 Themes Were Already Built: A DaisyUI Love Story" (71 chars, keyword at end)
  - ❌ BAD: "How I Built 347 Buttons Before Discovering Atomic Design" (keyword at end)

### Meta Description Requirements

- **Length**: 150-160 characters (no more, no less)
- **Content**: Must include primary keyword and value proposition
- **Format**: Complete sentences that compel clicks
- **Example**: "Discover how Docker transformed my development workflow from setup nightmares to instant productivity. Learn why Docker-first development eliminates conflicts." (155 chars)

### Heading Hierarchy (STRICT RULES)

- **ONE H1 ONLY**: The title is the ONLY H1 on the page
- **No H3 after H1**: If you have an H1, the next heading must be H2, never H3
- **Proper Structure**:

  ```markdown
  # Title (Only H1)

  ## Main Section (H2)

  ## Another Main Section (H2)

  ### Subsection (H3 only under H2)

  ## Not ### (Never H3 right after H1)
  ```

- **Include Keywords**: Add the primary keyword to at least 30% of H2 headings

### Keyword Distribution Requirements

- **Density**: 1-2% of total word count
- **Placement**:
  - MUST appear in title
  - MUST appear in first paragraph (first 100 words)
  - MUST appear in at least 30% of H2 headings
  - Should appear naturally throughout content
- **Variations**: Use related terms and synonyms
- **Example for "Docker"**: Also use "containerization", "containers", "Docker-first"

### Image Optimization

- **File Naming**: Use descriptive names WITHOUT dates
  - ✅ GOOD: `/blog-images/docker-development-setup.png`
  - ❌ BAD: `/blog-images/2025-10-03-docker-development-setup.png`
- **ogImage in Frontmatter**: Must match actual filename

### Content Flow Requirements

- **Sentence Length**: Combine short sentences for better flow
  - ❌ BAD: "I opened VS Code. I typed a command. It failed. I was frustrated."
  - ✅ GOOD: "I opened VS Code and typed a command, but it failed immediately, leaving me frustrated."
- **Transition Words**: Use at least 30% transition words
  - Start sentences with: Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally, However, Consequently, Therefore, Subsequently
  - Connect ideas with: as a result, in addition, on the other hand, for instance
- **Passive Voice**: Keep under 10% of sentences
  - ❌ BAD: "The bug was discovered by me"
  - ✅ GOOD: "I discovered the bug"

### First Paragraph Checklist

The first paragraph after the H1 MUST:

- [ ] Include the primary keyword naturally
- [ ] Be at least 50 words but no more than 100
- [ ] Set up the problem or story
- [ ] Include a transition word
- [ ] Avoid passive voice

### Common SEO Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Multiple H1s**: Never use more than one `#` heading
2. **Missing Keywords**: Always include primary keyword in title and first paragraph
3. **Title Too Long**: Keep under 60 characters
4. **Meta Description Wrong Length**: Must be 150-160 characters
5. **Choppy Sentences**: Combine related short sentences
6. **No Transitions**: Add connecting words between paragraphs
7. **Date in Image Path**: Remove dates from image filenames

## Frontmatter Requirements
