# GDPR Analytics: Tracking Users Without Being Creepy

> 🐳 **Docker First**: ScriptHammer is a Docker-first project. All commands should be run with `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm [command]`. Never run npm/pnpm directly on your host machine.

## The Day Google Analytics Became Illegal 🚨

**February 2022**: Austrian court rules Google Analytics violates GDPR.

**My reaction**: "Well, dang."

**The internet's reaction**: _Continues using Google Analytics_

**Smart developers**: Built privacy-first alternatives.

## ScriptHammer's Privacy-First Approach 🛡️

No Google Analytics. No Facebook Pixel. No creepy tracking.

Instead:

- **Plausible Analytics**: GDPR-compliant by default
- **No cookies**: Uses hash-based tracking
- **No personal data**: Just the metrics you need
- **Self-hostable**: Keep data on your servers

```typescript
// The entire integration
<Script
  defer
  data-domain="yourdomain.com"
  src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"
/>
```

That's it. You're GDPR compliant.
