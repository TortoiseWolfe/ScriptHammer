# EmailJS: Contact Forms Without a Backend

> 🐳 **Docker First**: ScriptHammer is a Docker-first project. All commands should be run with `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm [command]`. Never run npm/pnpm directly on your host machine.

## The Backend Developer's Confession 🙈

I'm a full-stack developer.

I've built entire backends.

But email servers? **Forget that.**

- SMTP configuration
- SPF records
- DKIM signatures
- IP reputation
- Spam filters
- Rate limiting
- Queue management

Or... just use EmailJS.

## How EmailJS Works in ScriptHammer 📧

```typescript
// That's it. That's the whole backend.
emailjs.send('service_id', 'template_id', formData);
```

No server. No configuration. No crying.

## The Setup That Takes 5 Minutes

1. Sign up at emailjs.com
2. Connect your email
3. Create a template
4. Add your IDs to `.env`
5. Deploy and forget

## What You Get

- Contact forms that work
- Email templates
- Auto-responses
- 200 free emails/month
- Zero maintenance

The best backend is no backend.
