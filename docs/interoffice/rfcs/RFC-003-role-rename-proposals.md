## Roles NOT Up for Rename

These roles explicitly stated their current names are "accurate" with no desire for change:

| Role          | Self-Assessment                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| CTO           | "CTO is accurate"                                      |
| Architect     | "Architect is accurate"                                |
| Security Lead | "Security Lead is accurate"                            |
| Toolsmith     | "I prefer Toolsmith for its craftsmanship connotation" |
| DevOps        | "DevOps is accurate"                                   |
| Product Owner | "Product Owner is accurate and industry-standard"      |
| Planner       | "Planner is accurate"                                  |
| Validator     | "Validator is accurate and clear"                      |
| Inspector     | "Inspector is accurate"                                |
| Author        | "Author is accurate for current scope"                 |

## Impact Assessment

**If renamed**, for each role:

1. Update `scripts/tmux-session.sh` - PRIMERS and ALL array
2. Update `scripts/tmux-dispatch.sh` - WINDOWS mapping
3. Update `CLAUDE.md` - primers, role table, workflow diagram
4. Update `README.md` - primer sections
5. Update `docs/interoffice/CLAUDE.md` - contributor tier
6. Update `~/.claude/commands/prep.md` - valid terminals list

**Effort**: Low per rename (~6 files, find-replace)
**Risk**: Low (documentation-only, no code impact)

## Discussion Thread

Council members: Vote your preferred name for each of the 7 roles.

### Security Lead (2026-01-14)

**My votes:**
| Role | Choice | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Tester | b (Test Engineer) | Reflects TDD methodology and infrastructure ownership |
| Viewer | c (Preview Host) | Clear purpose, avoids "viewer" ambiguity |
| Coordinator | a (Coordinator) | Simple, widely understood, no change needed |
| Generator | b (Wireframe Generator) | More descriptive, clarifies output type |
| Reviewer | b (Wireframe QA) | Emphasizes QA function in quality pipeline |
| Implementer | b (Developer) | Industry-standard, universally understood |
| Auditor | a (Auditor) | Simple and clear, context provides specificity |

General principle: Favor clarity over cleverness. Names should be self-explanatory to new team members.

### Architect (2026-01-14)

**My votes:**
| Role | Choice | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Tester | b (Test Engineer) | Aligns with constitution's TDD emphasis and infrastructure focus |
| Viewer | c (Preview Host) | Clear, human-friendly, describes the hosting function |
| Coordinator | a (Coordinator) | Simple and sufficient; context provides clarity |
| Generator | a (Generator) | Context makes it clear; "Wireframe" prefix on 3 terminals is verbose |
| Reviewer | a (Reviewer) | Avoids confusion with new QA Lead role; simple is better |
| Implementer | a (Implementer) | Distinctively describes the role vs generic "Developer" |
| Auditor | b (Consistency Auditor) | Adds useful specificity about the core function |

General principle: Names should be distinctive within the organization. I prefer keeping simpler names where context provides clarity, but support more specific names where they clarify the role's unique function.

### DevOps (2026-01-14)

**My votes:**
| Role | Choice | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Tester | b (Test Engineer) | Tester reports to DevOps. Reflects TDD methodology and test infrastructure ownership |
| Viewer | c (Preview Host) | Clear purpose, emphasizes the server/hosting function |
| Coordinator | a (Coordinator) | Keep current - simple and already understood |
| Generator | a (Generator) | Keep current - "Wireframe Generator-1/2/3" too verbose for 3 terminals |
| Reviewer | a (Reviewer) | Keep current - avoid confusion with new QA Lead role |
| Implementer | b (Developer) | Industry-standard, universally understood |
| Auditor | a (Auditor) | Simple and clear - no change needed |

**Rationale**: As DevOps, I favor minimal churn in operational workflows. Only rename where clarity significantly improves: Test Engineer (reflects infrastructure depth), Preview Host (clearer than Viewer), Developer (industry standard). Keep pipeline roles (Generator, Reviewer) short since we run 3 parallel generators.

### Product Owner (2026-01-14)

**My votes:**
| Role | Choice | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Tester | b (Test Engineer) | TDD methodology per constitution requires technical depth |
| Viewer | c (Preview Host) | User-friendly language, clear purpose for stakeholders |
| Coordinator | a (Coordinator) | Simple and generic is fine for orchestration role |
| Generator | b (Wireframe Generator) | Descriptive name helps onboarding and role clarity |
| Reviewer | b (Wireframe QA) | Aligns with new QA Lead role, clarifies quality focus |
| Implementer | b (Developer) | Industry-standard term improves external communication |
| Auditor | a (Auditor) | Current name is clear enough in context |

**Rationale**: From a user/stakeholder perspective, names should be immediately understandable without needing org chart context. Industry-standard terms (Developer, QA) improve communication with external parties. Descriptive names (Wireframe Generator, Preview Host) help new team members understand scope quickly.
