**Date**: 2026-01-15
**From**: Product Owner
**Category**: announcement

## Summary

RFC-006 has been proposed for council review. This RFC seeks approval to begin implementation planning for P1 Wave 1 foundation features after P0 is queued.

## Details

### Features in Scope

| Feature           | Purpose             | P1 Stories | Wireframes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 001-WCAG-AA       | Accessibility (AAA) | 4          | 3 SVGs     |
| 004-Mobile-First  | Responsive (320px+) | 2          | 2 SVGs     |
| 006-Template-Fork | Dev onboarding      | 2          | 2 SVGs     |

### Why Wave 1?

- **No P0 Dependencies**: Can plan in parallel with P0 implementation
- **No Interdependencies**: Can implement all three in parallel
- **Foundation Status**: Blocks downstream features (017, 018, 037, all UI)
- **Ready Now**: 7 SVGs, 0 validator errors
