## Success Criteria

- [ ] 80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] Bundle size under 400KB
- [ ] 30+ production-ready components
- [ ] Lighthouse score 95+
- [ ] Full TypeScript coverage
- [ ] Zero accessibility violations
- [ ] Complete API documentation

## Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): State Management + DataTable
2. **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Command Palette + Modal System
3. **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Animation Framework + Advanced Components
4. **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Developer Tools + Performance

## Notes

- These features extend beyond the PRP system
- Focus on developer experience and productivity
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document all new patterns
- Consider bundle size impact

## Not Included (Deliberate Omissions)

- Monorepo setup (unnecessary complexity)
- Backend implementation (template is frontend-focused)
- Native mobile apps (PWA is sufficient)
- Real-time features (WebSockets, etc.)
- Blockchain/Web3 integration (beyond scope)
