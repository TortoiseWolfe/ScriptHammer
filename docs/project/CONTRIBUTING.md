## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive criticism
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Prioritize the project's best interests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (MANDATORY)
- Git
- Node.js 18+ (only needed on host for git hooks)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**

   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CRUDkit.git
   cd CRUDkit
   ```

2. **Setup Docker Environment**

   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your user ID
   echo "UID=$(id -u)" > .env
   echo "GID=$(id -g)" >> .env

   # Start Docker development environment (MANDATORY)
   docker compose up
   ```

   **NOTE**: This project REQUIRES Docker. Local pnpm/npm is NOT supported.

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Docker Development (MANDATORY)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This project REQUIRES Docker to ensure consistent development environments.

```bash
# Start development environment
docker compose up

# Run commands in container
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm dev       # Dev server
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test      # Run tests
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm lint      # Run linting
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm format    # Format code
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm storybook  # Storybook
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm type-check # TypeScript
```

### Available Scripts (Run Inside Docker)

| Script                                                | Description                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm dev`           | Start Next.js development server |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm build`         | Build for production             |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test`          | Run Vitest tests                 |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test:coverage` | Generate coverage report         |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm lint`          | Run ESLint                       |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm format`        | Format code with Prettier        |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm format:check`  | Check formatting without changes |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm type-check`    | Run TypeScript type checking     |
| `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm storybook`     | Start Storybook development      |

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- We use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- All new code must be properly typed (no `any` unless absolutely necessary)
- Use interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/primitives
- Export types/interfaces that might be used elsewhere

### Code Style

- Code is automatically formatted with Prettier on commit
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Component Guidelines

We follow Atomic Design principles:

```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subatomic/    # Basic elements (Text, Button, Input)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ atomic/       # Simple components (Card, Modal)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ molecular/    # Composite components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ organisms/    # Complex sections
```

- Components should be in their own folders with:
  - `ComponentName.tsx` - Component file
  - `ComponentName.test.tsx` - Test file
  - `ComponentName.stories.tsx` - Storybook stories
  - `index.ts` - Export file

### Git Commit Messages

We use conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or fixes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements

Examples:

```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration
fix(ui): resolve theme switcher flickering
docs: update installation instructions
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Place tests next to the code they test (`Component.test.tsx`)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (inside Docker)
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test:coverage
```

### Coverage Requirements

Current minimum coverage thresholds:

- Statements: 0.5%
- Branches: 0.5%
- Functions: 0.5%
- Lines: 0.5%

These will increase as the project matures.
