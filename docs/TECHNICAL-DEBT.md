## Current Issues

### 7. Environment Variable Configuration Duplication

**Date Added**: 2025-09-25
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: Hot-reload system / nodemon configuration
**Impact**: Architectural confusion, maintenance overhead

**Issue**: Docker-specific environment variables are being set in the wrong location. The `nodemon-blog.json` configuration file contains Docker polling variables that should only be in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Current State (INCORRECT)**:

```json
// nodemon-blog.json
{
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development",
    "CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING": "true", // ❌ Docker-specific, wrong location
    "CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL": "500" // ❌ Docker-specific, wrong location
  }
}
```

**Correct Approach**:

- All Docker-specific environment variables should be in `docker-compose.yml` ONLY
- nodemon config should remain portable and environment-agnostic
- Docker polling settings belong in Docker configuration, not application config

**Impact**:

- Violates separation of concerns
- Creates confusion about where to configure Docker polling
- Makes nodemon config Docker-dependent when it shouldn't be
- Duplicates configuration across multiple files

**Resolution**:

1. Remove `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING` and `CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL` from `nodemon-blog.json`
2. Add `CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL=500` to `docker-compose.yml` environment section
3. Keep nodemon config generic for use in any environment
4. Document that Docker polling belongs in docker-compose.yml only

**Workaround**: Currently functioning but architecturally incorrect. The polling works with this setup but needs refactoring for proper separation of concerns.

## Current Issues

### 7. Disqus Theme Integration

**Date Added**: 2025-09-28
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: UX - Comments section doesn't fully match DaisyUI themes

**Issue**: Disqus comments component only supports basic light/dark theme detection, not the full range of 32 DaisyUI themes. Attempts to read actual theme colors using computed styles cause Disqus to fail loading.

**Current Workaround**: Simplified to basic light/dark detection with hardcoded RGB colors that Disqus can parse.

**Proper Solution**:

- Investigate alternative methods to pass theme colors to Disqus iframe
- Consider using CSS custom properties that Disqus can interpret
- Possibly implement a theme color mapping system

**Files Affected**:

- `/src/components/molecular/DisqusComments.tsx`

### 8. Next.js Dynamic Params Warning

**Date Added**: 2025-09-28
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: Dev warnings only, no production impact

**Issue**: Next.js 15 shows warnings about using `params.slug` without awaiting params first in blog pages.

**Current State**: Non-breaking warning in development logs.

**Proper Solution**: Update blog page components to properly await params before accessing properties per Next.js 15 best practices.

**Files Affected**:

- `/src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`

## Resolved Issues

### ~~6. lint-staged Git Stash Issues in Docker~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Date Added**: 2025-09-19
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-19
**Severity**: None
**Impact**: None

**Issue**: lint-staged failed with git stash errors when running inside Docker container.

**Resolution**:

- Added `--no-stash` flag to lint-staged commands in Docker
- Modified `.husky/pre-commit` to use `pnpm exec lint-staged --no-stash`
- Removed problematic `vitest related --run` from lint-staged config
- Works correctly in both Docker and host environments

### ~~1. Next.js 15.5 Static Export Compatibility~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Date Added**: 2025-09-18
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-19
**Severity**: None
**Impact**: None

**Issue**: Previously thought Next.js 15.5.2 with `output: 'export'` required dummy Pages Router files, but this was incorrect.

**Resolution**:

- Tested build without any Pages Router files - works perfectly
- Next.js 15.5.2 supports pure App Router with static export
- No dummy files or workarounds needed
- Build completes successfully after clearing cache (`pnpm run clean:next`)

### ~~2. ContactForm Storybook Stories~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Date Added**: 2025-09-18
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-19
**Severity**: None
**Impact**: None

**Issue**: Previously thought ContactForm stories failed with jest.mock() errors.

**Resolution**:

- MSW (Mock Service Worker) is already configured in `.storybook/preview.tsx`
- Web3Forms API mocks are already set up in `/src/mocks/handlers.ts`
- Stories should work without jest.mock()
- The perceived issue may have been a build cache problem

### ~~3. GoogleAnalytics Storybook Context Error~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Date Added**: 2025-09-18
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-19
**Severity**: None
**Impact**: None

**Issue**: Previously thought GoogleAnalytics stories failed due to missing ConsentProvider.

**Resolution**:

- ConsentProvider is already configured as a global decorator in `.storybook/preview.tsx` (line 52-54)
- The GoogleAnalytics stories already include a MockConsentWrapper for demonstration
- No additional fixes needed

### ~~4. Project Configuration Complexity~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Date Added**: 2025-09-18
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-19
**Severity**: None
**Impact**: None

**Issue**: Thought the auto-detection of project configuration added unnecessary complexity.

**Resolution**:

- The configuration is already simplified and clean
- No webpack workarounds found in the codebase
- The detection script is straightforward and works well
- Generated config is a simple TypeScript file with constants
- No further simplification needed

### ~~5. Husky Pre-commit Hook Docker Detection~~ ✅ RESOLVED

**Date Added**: 2025-09-19
**Date Resolved**: 2025-09-19
**Severity**: None
**Impact**: None

**Issue**: Pre-commit hook failed when committing from inside Docker container because it tried to run `docker compose ps` which doesn't exist inside the container.

**Resolution**:

- Added detection for running inside Docker container (checks for `/app` directory)
- Hook now handles three scenarios properly:
  1. Inside Docker: runs `pnpm lint:staged` directly
  2. Host with Docker: uses `docker compose exec`
  3. Host without Docker: runs `pnpm` locally
- No longer need `--no-verify` when committing from inside Docker

## Future Concerns

### ~~1. Security Headers~~ ✅ DOCUMENTED

**Impact**: Production security
**Documentation**: `/docs/deployment/security-headers.md`

With the removal of the `headers()` function from Next.js config (due to static export incompatibility), security headers need to be configured at the hosting level. Complete documentation now available with platform-specific configurations for:

- ✅ Vercel (vercel.json)
- ✅ Netlify (\_headers file)
- ✅ nginx configuration
- ✅ Apache (.htaccess)
- ✅ CloudFlare Pages (\_headers or Workers)

### ~~2. PWA Manifest API Route~~ ✅ RESOLVED (2025-09-18)

**Impact**: ~~PWA functionality~~ None
**Status**: Already using build-time generation

The PWA manifest is properly generated at build time via `scripts/generate-manifest.js` which runs in the prebuild step. No API route exists - fully compatible with static export.

### ~~3. Test Coverage for Offline Features~~ ✅ RESOLVED (2025-09-18)

**Impact**: ~~Test reliability~~ None
**Status**: All 12 offline queue tests now passing

The offline queue integration tests previously had issues with React Hook Form timing but are now working correctly. No further action needed.

## Code Cleanup Status

1. ~~**Pages Router Dummy Files** (`src/pages/*`)~~ - ✅ Removed (2025-09-18)
2. ~~**Security headers constants**~~ - ✅ None found in next.config.ts (2025-09-19)
3. ~~**Webpack workarounds**~~ - ✅ None found in project.config.ts (2025-09-19)

## Performance Optimizations ~~Needed~~ ✅ COMPLETED

### ~~3. Font Loading Optimization~~ ✅ OPTIMIZED (2025-09-19)

**Status**: Complete

- Added `display: swap` to Geist fonts for faster rendering
- Added font preconnect links to Google Fonts
- Added fallback font stacks to prevent layout shifts
- Set font-display and size-adjust properties in CSS
- Optimized text rendering properties for better performance

### ~~1. Bundle Size~~ ✅ OPTIMIZED (2025-09-18)

**Status**: Complete

- Current First Load JS: 102KB (meets target)
- Added @next/bundle-analyzer for monitoring
- Run `pnpm run analyze` to view bundle composition

### ~~2. Lazy Loading~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2025-09-18)

**Status**: Complete

- Calendar providers (CalendlyProvider, CalComProvider) now use dynamic imports
- Loading states implemented for better UX
- Maps already use dynamic loading with SSR disabled

3. **Font Loading**: Optimize font loading strategy to reduce CLS

## Testing Improvements

1. **Storybook Coverage**: Restore full story coverage for ContactForm
2. ~~**E2E Tests**: Currently only running locally, need CI integration~~ ✅ CI ADDED (2025-09-18)
   - Created `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` with multi-browser testing
   - Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
   - Artifacts and reports uploaded for review
3. **Visual Regression**: PRP-012 deferred but needed for UI stability

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. Update deployment guides for security headers configuration
2. Document the forking process with new auto-configuration system
3. Add troubleshooting guide for common build issues

## Test Coverage Improvements Needed

### Component Tests

1. **CaptainShipCrewWithNPC** (`src/components/atomic/CaptainShipCrewWithNPC/CaptainShipCrewWithNPC.test.tsx`)
   - TODO comment on line 14: "Add more specific tests"
   - Currently only has basic render test
   - Need tests for game logic, player interactions, NPC behavior

### Accessibility Tests

Multiple components have TODO comments for expanding test coverage:

- **CaptainShipCrewWithNPC** (`CaptainShipCrewWithNPC.accessibility.test.tsx`) - line 14
- **CaptainShipCrew** (`CaptainShipCrew.accessibility.test.tsx`) - line 14
- **Dice** (`Dice.accessibility.test.tsx`) - line 14
- **DraggableDice** (`DraggableDice.accessibility.test.tsx`) - line 14
- **DiceTray** (`DiceTray.accessibility.test.tsx`) - line 14

Each TODO indicates need for:

- Tests with different prop combinations
- Keyboard navigation testing
- ARIA attribute verification
- Color contrast validation
- Focus management testing

## Feature Extensions Needed

### Validation System Extension

**Location**: `src/components/atomic/CaptainShipCrewWithNPC/CaptainShipCrewWithNPC.tsx`
**TODO**: Line 8 - "Add validation to other atomic components throughout the app"

- Current implementation demonstrates validation system with ValidatedInput
- Should extend to other atomic components: Button, Input, and other form components
- This would improve form consistency and error handling across the application

### Error Handler Integrations

**Location**: `src/utils/error-handler.ts`

1. **Logging Service Integration**
   - TODO on line 233: "Implement additional integration with logging service"
   - Currently only logs to console in development
   - Should integrate with services like Sentry, LogRocket, or DataDog
   - Would provide better production error tracking

2. **Notification System Integration**
   - TODO on line 252: "Integrate with your notification system"
   - Currently only logs user notifications to console
   - Should integrate with a proper toast/notification system
   - Would improve user experience for error feedback

## Template TODOs (Intentional)

The following TODO comments are part of code generation templates and are intentional:

1. **migrate-components.js** (lines 304, 350)
   - Template placeholders for generated test files
   - Gets replaced with actual test code when components are migrated

2. **validate-structure.test.js** (lines 152, 154)
   - Test fixtures for validation testing
   - Used to simulate incomplete component structures

These TODOs should remain as they are part of the tooling infrastructure.
