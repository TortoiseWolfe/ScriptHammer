## 🎯 When to Use Full Workflow

### ✅ Use PRP/SpecKit Workflow For:

- New features (medium to high complexity)
- External service integrations (APIs, third-party services)
- Significant refactoring or architectural changes
- Features requiring multiple components
- Features taking >1 day to implement
- Features with unclear or evolving requirements
- Privacy-sensitive features (GDPR compliance needed)

### ❌ Skip Workflow For:

- Bug fixes (unless requiring architectural changes)
- Typo corrections and documentation tweaks
- Dependency version bumps (routine maintenance)
- Simple styling changes (CSS/Tailwind adjustments)
- Emergency hotfixes
- Features taking <2 hours

**Rule of Thumb**: If you're unsure whether to use the workflow, use it. Better documented than undocumented.

## 🚦 Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Component

```bash
# Write PRP emphasizing 5-file structure
vim docs/prp-docs/my-component-prp.md

# Create branch and run workflow
./scripts/prp-to-feature.sh my-component 023
/specify New atomic button component with size/color variants
/plan Use component generator, follow 5-file pattern, DaisyUI theme support
/tasks

# Execute (use generator)
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component MyButton
# ... implement following tasks.md
```

### Pattern 2: External Service Integration

```bash
# Write PRP with privacy/consent focus
vim docs/prp-docs/analytics-service-prp.md

# Create branch with GDPR context
./scripts/prp-to-feature.sh analytics-service 024
/specify Analytics integration with GDPR compliance and consent
/plan Consent modal required before loading, respect user choice
/tasks

# Implement consent flow FIRST, then integration
```

### Pattern 3: Documentation Feature

```bash
# Write PRP focused on docs (like this one!)
vim docs/prp-docs/feature-docs-prp.md

# Run workflow
./scripts/prp-to-feature.sh feature-docs 025
/specify Documentation for [feature] with real codebase examples
/plan Markdown files in docs/, use existing PRPs as examples
/tasks

# Write documentation following style guide
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall                              | Solution                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Writing HOW in PRP**               | PRPs describe WHAT/WHY, not HOW. Save implementation details for `/plan`          |
| **Skipping `/specify`**              | Always convert PRP format → SpecKit format. Don't use PRP as spec.md directly     |
| **Wrong command order**              | Follow sequence: `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`. Don't skip steps |
| **Manual component creation**        | Always use `pnpm run generate:component`. CI/CD will fail otherwise               |
| **Tasks without tests**              | TDD is mandatory. Write tests first, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)          |
| **Ignoring `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`** | Resolve all ambiguities with `/clarify` before planning                           |
| **Missing `[P]` markers**            | Mark parallel tasks so they can run concurrently. Speeds up implementation        |
| **Forgetting to update tasks.md**    | Mark tasks `[x]` as you complete them. Tracks progress                            |

## 🎓 Real Examples

### Example 1: PRP-010 (EmailJS Integration)

**What**: Backup email service with automatic failover from Web3Forms

**Workflow**:

1. PRP written with provider pattern and retry logic
2. `/specify` → 8 functional requirements generated
3. `/plan` → Provider abstraction, exponential backoff, rate limiting
4. `/tasks` → 15 tasks (setup → tests → implementation → polish)
5. `/implement` → 100% test coverage achieved

**Files Created**:

- `src/services/email/providers/emailjs.ts`
- `src/services/email/email-service.ts`
- Comprehensive test suite

**Outcome**: Production-ready email service in 1 day with 100% coverage

### Example 2: PRP-013 (Calendar Integration)

**What**: Embedded scheduling with Calendly and Cal.com support

**Workflow**:

1. PRP identified GDPR implications early (consent needed)
2. `/specify` → User scenarios included consent flow
3. `/clarify` → Which providers? (Answer: both Calendly and Cal.com)
4. `/plan` → Dynamic imports, consent modal pattern
5. `/tasks` → 12 tasks (consent UI → provider integration → tests)

**Files Created**:

- `src/components/calendar/CalendarEmbed/`
- `src/components/privacy/CalendarConsentModal/`
- Integration tests

**Outcome**: GDPR-compliant calendar integration with <150KB bundle impact

### Example 3: PRP-001 (This Guide!)

**What**: Document PRP/SpecKit methodology integration

**Workflow**:

1. PRP written with 7 sections (prp-methodology-prp.md)
2. `/specify` → 13 FR, 5 NFR generated
3. `/clarify` → No ambiguities (comprehensive PRP)
4. `/plan` → Documentation strategy with real examples
5. `/tasks` → 14 documentation tasks
6. `/implement` → This guide you're reading!

**Files Created**:

- This file (`SPECKIT-PRP-GUIDE.md`)
- Updates to `PRP-WORKFLOW.md`
- Updates to `CLAUDE.md`

**Outcome**: Demonstrates workflow by using it (dogfooding)

## 📊 Task Markers

### Understanding Task Notation

```markdown
## Phase: Documentation Writing

### T004: [P] Write quick reference guide

### T005: [P] Update workflow documentation

### T006: [P] Add real examples

### T007: Update CLAUDE.md (depends on T004)
```

**Key**:

- `T###` = Task number for tracking
- `[P]` = Parallel - can run concurrently with other `[P]` tasks
- No `[P]` = Sequential - must run in order (dependencies or shared files)
- `depends on T###` = Explicit dependency noted

**Parallel Tasks**: Different files, no dependencies → can work simultaneously
**Sequential Tasks**: Same file or dependencies → must complete in order

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: `/specify` says spec already exists

**Solution**: You're on a feature branch with existing spec.md. Either:

- Delete `specs/<branch>/spec.md` and run `/specify` again
- Switch to a different branch
- Use the existing spec.md if it's current

### Issue: SpecKit scripts not found

**Solution**: Scripts in `.specify/scripts/bash/` may not exist in all repos. SpecKit commands work without them (they manually resolve paths). This is normal.

### Issue: PRP too vague, can't generate concrete spec

**Solution**:

1. Run `/clarify` to identify gaps
2. Answer clarification questions
3. Iterate on PRP with more detail
4. Run `/specify` again

### Issue: Generated tasks have circular dependencies

**Solution**:

1. Review `tasks.md` dependency graph
2. Manually reorder tasks if needed
3. Report issue for template improvement

### Issue: Don't know if feature needs full workflow

**Solution**: Use decision tree above. **When in doubt, use the workflow**. Documentation overhead is better than lack of documentation.

### Issue: Forgot to mark tasks complete

**Solution**: Edit `specs/<branch>/tasks.md` and change `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed tasks. Helps track progress.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: First PRP? Pick something simple to learn the workflow
2. **Use Examples**: Copy structure from similar completed PRPs
3. **Be Specific**: Clear success criteria → clear implementation
4. **Test Early**: `/analyze` before `/implement` catches issues early
5. **Commit Often**: Commit after each phase (specify, plan, tasks)
6. **Real Examples**: Reference actual PRPs, not hypotheticals
7. **Ask Questions**: Use `/clarify` liberally - better to ask than guess
