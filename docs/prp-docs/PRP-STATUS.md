## v0.4.0 — Payments (Active Tracking)

**Status**: 1/6 payment features in progress (024), 5/6 not started (038–042). Feature 043 misfiled under payments — it's a messaging feature.

**Key insight**: The E2E test suite already contains **~47 skipped test stubs** in `tests/e2e/payment/*.spec.ts` that document required behavior for each feature. These stubs ARE the acceptance criteria — when a feature lands, its corresponding skipped tests should be un-skipped and made to pass. This is the cleanest path to reducing scope creep and measuring "done".

**Missing routes** (referenced by multiple skipped tests):

- `/payment/dashboard` — blocks 038
- `/payment/subscriptions` — blocks 038, 040, 041
- `/payment/history` — blocks 039
- `/payment/result` — blocks 040

**Tracking source of truth**: The status lines in each `*_feature.md` file were updated 2026-04-08 to reflect actual state. When any payment feature progresses, update:

1. Its `**Status**:` line in the feature file
2. The row in this table
3. Un-skip the corresponding E2E tests and make them pass on the next CI run

## Lessons Learned

### Successful Patterns

**PRPs (Features)**:

- **Component Structure (PRP-002)**: 5-file pattern enforced via CI/CD ensures consistency
- **E2E Testing (PRP-003)**: Page Object Model provides maintainable test architecture
- **Docker-first development**: Consistent environment across all developers
- **Cookie Consent (PRP-007)**: Context-based consent management with localStorage persistence
- **Google Analytics (PRP-008)**: Privacy-first GA4 integration with consent mode, debug utilities
- **Web3Forms (PRP-009)**: Contact form with Zod validation, honeypot spam protection, TDD approach (98% coverage)
- **PWA Background Sync (PRP-011)**: IndexedDB queue, service worker sync, comprehensive offline support
- **EmailJS Integration (PRP-010)**: Provider pattern with automatic failover, retry logic, rate limiting, 100% test coverage
- **Calendar Integration (PRP-013)**: GDPR-compliant consent for third-party scheduling services
- **Geolocation Map (PRP-014)**: Leaflet.js with dynamic imports, OpenStreetMap tiles, GDPR consent modal

**Sprint 3.5 (Technical Debt)**:

- **Build System**: Next.js 15.5 works without Pages Router dummy files
- **Docker Integration**: Husky pre-commit hooks detect and handle Docker environment
- **lint-staged**: Fixed git stash issues with --no-stash flag
- **Performance**: Font loading optimized with display:swap and preconnect
- **Documentation**: Technical debt accurately tracked with TODO categorization

### Challenges & Solutions

- **CI/CD pnpm versions**: Standardized to exact version 10.16.1 across all workflows
- **E2E in CI**: Tests require dev server, made local-only with clear documentation
- **Missing dependencies**: Added to Dockerfile for consistency (Playwright deps)
- **PRP-009 Deferred Tasks**: Offline support (T010-T011) moved to PRP-011, enhanced security features (T012-T016) marked as optional future enhancements
- **PRP-011 Test Issues**: 4 integration tests fail due to React Hook Form async validation timing (production works correctly)
- **PRP-014 Desktop Accuracy**: IP-based geolocation limited to city-level accuracy, documented as PRP-015 for v0.4.0

### Process Improvements

- **PRP workflow**: Clear /plan and /tasks commands streamline implementation
- **Parallel task execution**: Identified independent tasks for faster completion
- **TDD approach**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle ensures quality

## Next Actions

### Post-Sprint 3.5 Options (Choose One)

1. **PRP-001 (PRP Methodology Documentation)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
   - Document the successful PRP process while it's fresh
   - Create reusable framework for future development
   - Low effort, high value

2. **Component Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Address 6 TODO comments in game components
   - Add comprehensive tests for CaptainShipCrew features
   - Improves code reliability

3. **Notification System Implementation**
   - Replace console logs with toast notifications
   - Better UX for errors and success messages
   - Professional user feedback

4. **Production Error Tracking**
   - Integrate Sentry or LogRocket
   - Essential for production monitoring
   - TODO in error-handler.ts

### Sprint 4 Planning (v0.4.0)

**Advanced Features**:

1. State Management (Zustand/Jotai)
2. Animation System (Framer Motion)
3. UI Components (Command Palette, DataTable, Modal)
4. OKLCH Color System Scripts
5. Developer Tools CLI

**Deferred PRPs**:

- **PRP-012**: Visual Regression Testing (wait for stable UI)
- **PRP-015**: Enhanced Geolocation Accuracy (hybrid approach)

### Blocked Items

## Resource Links

- [PRP Workflow Documentation](./PRP-WORKFLOW.md)
- [Constitution](./.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- [Original SPEC](./SPEC.md)
- [PRP Template](../spec-kit/prp/templates/prp-template.md)

## Notes

### Risk Factors

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: GA4 integration depends on cookie consent
- **Low Risk**: Calendar and geolocation are independent

### Dependencies on External Services

- Web3Forms: Requires API key
- EmailJS: Requires account setup
- Google Analytics: Requires GA4 property
- Calendly/Cal.com: Requires account
- Chromatic/Percy: Requires account for visual regression

### Technical Debt Tracking

#### PRP-011: PWA Background Sync

- **Issue**: 4 integration tests fail due to React Hook Form async validation timing
- **Impact**: Test environment only, no production impact
- **Tests Affected**: offline-integration.test.tsx (4 tests)
- **Root Cause**: Complex mocking of hooks with form validation lifecycle
- **Recommendation**: Split into focused unit tests + E2E tests
- **Priority**: Low (production works correctly)

## Deferred Features from Completed PRPs

### PRP-009: Web3Forms Integration

The following tasks were deferred for future implementation as separate mini-PRPs:

#### Offline Support (T010-T011)

- **T010**: Implement offline submission queue
- **T011**: Update Service Worker for background sync
- **Priority**: P1 Important
- **Rationale**: Core functionality working, offline can be added later

#### Enhanced Security (T012-T016)

- **T013**: Implement client-side rate limiting
- **T014**: Add spam protection (honeypot field)
- **T016**: Implement form analytics tracking
- **Priority**: P1 Important
- **Rationale**: Basic protection in place, can enhance later

#### User Experience (T017-T020)

- **T017**: Add form draft auto-save feature
- **T020**: File attachment support
- **Priority**: P2 Nice to have
- **Rationale**: Core form working, these are enhancements

#### Known Issues

- 4 minor accessibility test failures in ContactForm component
- Missing navigation link to /contact page in header menu
- See `/specs/009-web3forms-integration/COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for full details
