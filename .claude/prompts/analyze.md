# /analyze - Validate Alignment & Surface Inconsistencies

Perform a comprehensive analysis of the project's spec-driven development artifacts to ensure alignment and identify inconsistencies.

## What to Analyze

1. **Document Alignment**
   - Compare `spec.md` with `plan.md`
   - Verify `TASKS.md` matches the plan
   - Check documentation consistency

2. **Implementation Alignment**
   - Compare code with specifications
   - Verify test coverage matches requirements
   - Check feature completeness

3. **Inconsistency Detection**
   - Identify conflicting information
   - Find missing dependencies
   - Detect scope drift

4. **Progress Assessment**
   - Review completed vs planned tasks
   - Identify blockers and delays
   - Assess technical debt

## Analysis Process

1. Read all project artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, TASKS.md)
2. Scan codebase for implementation status
3. Compare planned vs actual progress
4. Generate comprehensive report

## Output Format

Provide a structured report with:

- **Alignment Status**: Areas in sync vs misaligned
- **Inconsistencies Found**: Specific conflicts or gaps
- **Missing Elements**: Unimplemented requirements
- **Recommendations**: Priority fixes and next steps
- **Risk Assessment**: Critical issues requiring attention

This is a **read-only** analysis - no files will be modified.
