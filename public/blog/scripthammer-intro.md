# Scripthammer: Your Production-Ready Next.js Template

Scripthammer is an opinionated Next.js template that comes batteries-included with everything you need to build modern web applications. No more setup fatigue - just clone and start building.

## What's Actually In This Template

### Core Technologies

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 15.5.2** with App Router and static export support
- **[React](https://react.dev/) 19.1.0** with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) strict mode
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Cascading Style Sheets) v4** with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) providing 32 built-in themes
- **PWA Support** with offline capabilities via [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/)
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-First Development** - everything runs in containers

### Real Features That Work

#### üé® 32 Theme System

Not just light and dark mode - we ship with 32 complete themes from [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/):

- Classic: light, dark, cupcake, bumblebee
- Modern: synthwave, cyberpunk, valentine, halloween
- Professional: corporate, business, emerald, forest
- Experimental: acid, lemonade, coffee, winter

Theme switching is instant and persisted across sessions.

#### ‚ôø Accessibility Built-In

- Color vision assistance for 8 types of color blindness
- Font size scaling system
- Screen reader optimizations
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 AA compliance ready

#### üß™ Testing That Actually Runs

![Testing Suite Output](/blog-images/scripthammer-intro/testing-output.svg)
Comprehensive test suite with unit, E2E (End-to-End), and accessibility testing

```bash
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:suite
```

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit tests (58% coverage)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E (End-to-End) testing (40+ tests)
- [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) for accessibility testing
- Component structure validation
- Pre-push hooks with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)

#### üì± True PWA Support

- Service worker with offline mode
- Background sync for form submissions
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for local data storage
- App manifest for installability
- Push notification ready

## Docker Development Environment (MANDATORY)

![Docker Architecture](/blog-images/scripthammer-intro/docker-architecture.svg)
Docker-first development environment with isolated containers

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: ScriptHammer is Docker-only. Local npm/pnpm commands are NOT supported and WILL NOT WORK.

Everything MUST run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). No "works on my machine" problems:

```bash
# Start development (REQUIRED - no local alternative)
docker compose up

# ALL commands must use docker compose exec:
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run dev
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component

# ‚ùå NEVER run locally:
# pnpm install  # WILL NOT WORK
# npm run dev   # WILL NOT WORK
```

## Component Generator

Stop copying component boilerplate. Use the generator:

```bash
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component MyComponent atomic
```

This creates the required 5-file structure:

- `MyComponent.tsx` - Main component
- `MyComponent.test.tsx` - Unit tests
- `MyComponent.stories.tsx` - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) stories
- `MyComponent.accessibility.test.tsx` - A11y tests
- `index.tsx` - Barrel export

## Project Configuration

The project auto-detects most configuration from your Git repository:

```typescript
// Auto-configured from git remote at build time
const projectConfig = {
  name: 'YourRepoName', // Detected from repository
  owner: 'YourGitHubUsername',
  basePath: '/', // Configured for GitHub Pages
  repository: 'https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName',
};
```

Minimal setup required - just create your `.env` file and the rest is detected automatically.

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Quick validation
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:quick

# Full test suite
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:suite

# Specific tests
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run type-check
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run lint

```

## Why Scripthammer?

1. **Quick Setup** - Create `.env`, run `docker compose up`, and you're developing
2. **Reduced Configuration** - Opinionated choices with auto-detection from git
3. **Production Features** - Battle-tested components and patterns
4. **TypeScript First** - Comprehensive typing with strict mode enabled
5. **Well Tested** - Full test suite with unit, E2E, and accessibility testing

## Getting Started (Docker Required)

**‚ö†Ô∏è PREREQUISITE**: Docker and Docker Compose MUST be installed. This project does NOT support local development.

```bash
# Use the template on GitHub first
# Then clone YOUR new repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-new-repo.git
cd your-new-repo

# Create required .env file (MANDATORY)
cp .env.example .env

# Start Docker (ONLY way to run this project)
docker compose up  # First build takes 5-10 minutes

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Remember**:

- ‚úÖ `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm install` - Correct
- ‚ùå `pnpm install` - Will NOT work
- ‚ùå `npm install` - Will NOT work
