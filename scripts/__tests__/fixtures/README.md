# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample component structures used for testing the component structure validation and migration tools.

## Structure

- `compliant/` - Components that follow the 4-file pattern correctly
- `non-compliant/` - Components missing required files
- `edge-cases/` - Special cases and boundary conditions

## Usage

These fixtures are created dynamically by tests and should not be committed to the repository.
