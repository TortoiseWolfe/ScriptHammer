**Workflow Design:**

```yaml
- name: Run Pa11y CI
  run: pnpm run test:a11y
- name: Upload results
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

### Browser Testing Strategy

#### Headless Chrome (Selected) ✅

**Why Selected:**

- Default Pa11y runner
- Most accurate representation of user experience
- Excellent performance in CI environments
- Consistent results across environments

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "chromeLaunchConfig": {
    "args": [
      "--no-sandbox",
      "--disable-setuid-sandbox",
      "--disable-dev-shm-usage"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Testing Strategy

#### Three-Tier Testing Approach (Selected) ✅

1. **Component Level (jest-axe)**
   - Unit testing individual components
   - Fast feedback during development
   - Prevents regressions in component library

2. **Page Level (Pa11y CI)**
   - Full page accessibility validation
   - Tests component interactions
   - Validates routing and navigation

3. **Runtime Development (axe-core/react)**
   - Real-time feedback during development
   - Catches issues immediately
   - Non-blocking, developer-friendly

### Configuration Management

#### Centralized Configuration (Selected) ✅

**Structure:**

```
.pa11yci/
├── config.json           # Main configuration
├── custom-rules.js       # Project-specific rules
└── ignore-list.json      # Managed exceptions
```

**Why Selected:**

- Single source of truth for accessibility rules
- Easy to maintain and update
- Version controlled exceptions
- Clear separation of concerns

### Reporting Strategy

#### Multi-Format Reporting (Selected) ✅

1. **CLI Reporter**: Developer feedback during development
2. **JSON Reporter**: Programmatic access for dashboard
3. **HTML Reporter**: Stakeholder-friendly reports

**Storage Strategy:**

- Development: Console + file system
- CI: Artifacts + JSON for dashboard
- Production: API endpoints for historical data

### Integration with Existing Architecture

#### Next.js 15 App Router Integration ✅

**New Routes:**

- `/accessibility/dashboard` - Main accessibility dashboard
- `/api/accessibility/scores` - JSON API for results

**Existing Integration Points:**

- Extends existing AccessibilityContext
- Leverages configured Storybook a11y addon
- Integrates with existing Vitest test suite

#### DaisyUI Theme System Integration ✅

**Challenge:** 32 themes with potential contrast issues
**Solution:**

- Systematic testing of all themes
- Temporary ignore list during migration
- Theme-specific test configurations

## Performance Considerations

### CI/CD Performance

#### Optimization Strategies (Selected) ✅

1. **Parallel Testing**: Test multiple pages concurrently
2. **Selective Testing**: Only test changed routes in PR builds
3. **Caching**: Cache Pa11y browser instances
4. **Early Exit**: Fail fast on critical violations

**Performance Targets:**

- < 2 minutes total CI runtime for accessibility tests
- < 30 seconds for single page test
- < 500ms for component-level tests

### Development Performance

#### Runtime Impact Minimization (Selected) ✅

1. **Conditional Loading**: Only load axe-core in development
2. **Debounced Checking**: Avoid excessive re-runs during file watching
3. **Selective Rules**: Disable heavy rules during development

**Performance Targets:**

- < 100ms additional startup time in development
- < 50ms per component test
- < 500ms for file watcher re-runs

## Security Considerations

### CI/CD Security

#### Sandboxing (Selected) ✅

```json
{
  "chromeLaunchConfig": {
    "args": ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-setuid-sandbox"]
  }
}
```

**Why Needed:**

- Required for headless Chrome in Docker/CI environments
- Standard practice for Pa11y CI integration
- Mitigates privilege escalation risks

### Data Privacy

#### Local Data Storage (Selected) ✅

- Accessibility results stored locally or in artifacts
- No external service dependencies
- Compliance with data privacy requirements

## Compliance Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Coverage

#### Automated Testing Coverage ✅

**Can Test (via Pa11y/axe-core):**

- Color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes and roles
- Form labels and descriptions
- Heading structure
- Link purposes
- Image alt texts

**Cannot Test (requires manual verification):**

- Screen reader experience quality
- Cognitive accessibility
- Context-dependent content
- Complex user interactions

#### Manual Testing Strategy

1. **Screen Reader Testing**: Basic NVDA/JAWS verification
2. **Keyboard-Only Testing**: Full application navigation
3. **Color Blind Testing**: Using browser extensions
4. **Focus Management**: Tab order and focus indicators
