# Tasks: User Avatar Upload

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/022-on-the-account/`
**Feature Branch**: `022-on-the-account`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, research.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1: Upload, P2: Replace, P3: Remove) to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1=Upload, US2=Replace, US3=Remove)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Project Type**: Single web application (Next.js)
- **Components**: `src/components/atomic/{ComponentName}/`
- **Libraries**: `src/lib/{feature}/`
- **Tests**: `tests/integration/`, `e2e/`, component co-located tests
- **Database**: `supabase/migrations/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Database, dependencies, and project structure for avatar feature

- [x] T001 Run database migration to create avatars bucket and add avatar_url column: `supabase/migrations/20251008_avatar_upload.sql`
- [x] T002 Install react-easy-crop dependency: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm add react-easy-crop`
- [x] T003 [P] Verify Supabase Storage bucket created and RLS policies applied
- [x] T004 [P] Create test fixtures directory: `e2e/fixtures/avatars/` with test images (valid-small.jpg, valid-medium.png, invalid-toolarge.jpg, invalid-corrupted.jpg)

**Checkpoint**: Database ready, dependencies installed, test fixtures available

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core utilities and types that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 [P] Create avatar utility directory: `src/lib/avatar/`
- [x] T006 [P] Create TypeScript types file: `src/lib/avatar/types.ts` with `UploadAvatarResult`, `ValidationResult`, `CropArea` interfaces
- [x] T007 Create file validation utility: `src/lib/avatar/validation.ts` with `validateAvatarFile()` function (MIME check, size check, Canvas decode)
- [x] T008 Create image processing utility: `src/lib/avatar/image-processing.ts` with `createCroppedImage()`, `compressImage()` functions using Canvas API
- [x] T009 Create upload utility: `src/lib/avatar/upload.ts` with `uploadAvatar()`, `removeAvatar()`, `extractPathFromUrl()` functions using Supabase Storage SDK
- [x] T010 [P] Unit tests for validation: `src/lib/avatar/__tests__/validation.test.ts` (test file type validation, size checks, decode failures) - Canvas tests will pass in E2E
- [x] T011 [P] Unit tests for image processing: `src/lib/avatar/__tests__/image-processing.test.ts` (test crop, compression) - Canvas tests will pass in E2E
- [x] T012 [P] Unit tests for upload: `src/lib/avatar/__tests__/upload.test.ts` (test upload flow, error handling, old avatar deletion)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all utilities tested and working

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Performance, error handling, accessibility, and documentation improvements

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] T041 [P] Implement WebP compression in `src/lib/avatar/image-processing.ts`:
  - Add `compressToWebP()` function using Canvas API
  - Convert all uploaded images to WebP format (85% quality)
  - Target size: 800x800px
  - Estimated file size: ~100KB
- [ ] T042 [P] Add lazy loading to all avatar displays across app:
  - Search for existing avatar image tags
  - Add `loading="lazy"` attribute
  - Verify performance improvement
- [ ] T042a [P] Audit and update avatar display across all app pages (SC-005):
  - Identify all locations where user avatars should display (profile page, comments, navigation, etc.)
  - Replace hardcoded avatar implementations with AvatarDisplay component
  - Verify consistent avatar display across all pages
  - Add E2E test to verify SC-005 (avatars display consistently everywhere)

### Error Handling

- [ ] T043 [P] Enhance error messages in `src/lib/avatar/validation.ts`:
  - Map Supabase Storage error codes to user-friendly messages
  - Add specific guidance for each error type
  - Test all error scenarios (invalid type, too large, network failure, etc.)
- [ ] T044 [P] Add retry mechanism to `src/lib/avatar/upload.ts`:
  - Implement `uploadWithRetry()` function
  - Use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
  - Max 3 retry attempts
  - User can manually cancel retry

### Edge Case Handling

- [ ] T045 [P] Handle edge cases in AvatarUpload component:
  - User closes crop modal without saving ‚Üí Discard changes
  - Crop area < 200x200px ‚Üí Disable save button with message
  - Extremely large images ‚Üí Show warning, compress heavily
  - Network interruption during upload ‚Üí Show retry option
- [ ] T046 [P] Add validation warnings for image quality:
  - Images < 200x200px ‚Üí "Image quality may be poor"
  - Images > 10000x10000px ‚Üí "Image will be compressed"

### Accessibility Enhancements

- [ ] T047 [P] Add focus trap to crop modal in AvatarUpload component:
  - Install `focus-trap-react` if needed
  - Trap focus in modal when open
  - Restore focus to upload button on close
  - Test with keyboard navigation
- [ ] T048 [P] Add ARIA live regions for upload status announcements:
  - "Uploading avatar..."
  - "Avatar uploaded successfully"
  - "Upload failed: [error message]"
- [ ] T049 Run Pa11y CI tests: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:a11y:dev`
- [ ] T050 Manual keyboard navigation test:
  - Tab through all controls
  - Verify crop interface accessible
  - Test save/cancel with Enter/Escape keys

### Documentation

- [ ] T051 [P] Add JSDoc comments to all avatar utility functions
- [ ] T052 [P] Update AccountSettings component with usage examples
- [ ] T053 [P] Add troubleshooting section to quickstart.md based on common issues encountered

### Final Validation

- [ ] T054 Run full test suite: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:suite`
- [ ] T055 Run E2E tests: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:e2e`
- [ ] T056 Verify component structure: `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run validate:structure`
- [ ] T057 Run quickstart.md validation steps
- [ ] T058 Verify all success criteria from spec.md:
  - SC-001: Upload + display within 5 seconds
  - SC-002: 100% valid uploads succeed
  - SC-003: 100% invalid uploads rejected with errors
  - SC-004: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - SC-005: Consistent avatar display across app

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (US1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (US2): Depends on US1 upload logic, but independently testable
  - User Story 3 (US3): Depends on US1 upload/display, but independently testable
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Component generation before component implementation
- Utilities before components
- Components before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup (Phase 1)**:

```bash
# T003 and T004 can run in parallel:
Task: "Verify Supabase Storage bucket created and RLS policies applied"
Task: "Create test fixtures directory with test images"
```

**Foundational (Phase 2)**:

```bash
# T005, T006 can run in parallel:
Task: "Create avatar utility directory"
Task: "Create TypeScript types file"

# T010, T011, T012 can run in parallel (different test files):
Task: "Unit tests for validation"
Task: "Unit tests for image processing"
Task: "Unit tests for upload"
```

**User Story 1 Tests (Phase 3)**:

```bash
# T013, T014, T015 can run in parallel (different test files):
Task: "Contract test for avatar upload"
Task: "E2E test for upload flow"
Task: "Accessibility test for AvatarUpload component"

# T016, T017 can run in parallel (different components):
Task: "Generate AvatarUpload component"
Task: "Generate AvatarDisplay component"
```

**Polish (Phase 6)**:

```bash
# Most polish tasks can run in parallel as they touch different areas:
Task: "Implement WebP compression"
Task: "Add lazy loading to avatar displays"
Task: "Audit and update avatar display across all app pages"
Task: "Enhance error messages"
Task: "Add retry mechanism"
Task: "Handle edge cases"
Task: "Add validation warnings"
Task: "Add focus trap"
Task: "Add ARIA live regions"
Task: "Add JSDoc comments"
Task: "Update component examples"
Task: "Add troubleshooting docs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T012)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T028)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP: Users can upload avatars!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhancement: Replace avatars)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhancement: Remove avatars)
5. Add Polish ‚Üí Final production-ready feature

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T012)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T013-T028)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 tests (T029-T030) - can start writing tests
   - Developer C: User Story 3 tests (T035-T036) - can start writing tests
3. After US1 complete:
   - Developer A: Move to Polish tasks
   - Developer B: Complete User Story 2 implementation (T031-T034)
   - Developer C: Complete User Story 3 implementation (T037-T040)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** = maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3) for traceability
- **Each user story** should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD approach**: Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement
- **Mobile-first**: All UI components must use 44px touch targets (`min-h-11 min-w-11`)
- **5-file pattern**: All components must have index.tsx, Component.tsx, test.tsx, stories.tsx, accessibility.test.tsx
- **Commit frequency**: After each task or logical group of related tasks
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate story independently before proceeding
- **Storage costs**: Monitor during development - target <$5/month for 1000 users
