# Phase 0: Research & Analysis

## Current Testing Landscape

### Existing Test Infrastructure

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with 111+ tests, 58% coverage
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library
- **Accessibility**: Pa11y in CI pipeline
- **Visual**: Storybook for component documentation
- **Missing**: End-to-end user journey validation

### Gap Analysis

1. **No cross-browser testing** - Unit tests don't run in real browsers
2. **No PWA validation** - Service worker, offline mode untested
3. **No user flow testing** - Multi-step journeys not validated
4. **No mobile viewport testing** - Responsive design unchecked
5. **No performance testing** - Page load times unmeasured

| TypeScript         | First-class                   | Good                  | Basic         | Good        |
| Debugging          | Trace viewer, VSCode          | Time travel           | Basic         | DevTools    |
| CI Integration     | Excellent                     | Excellent             | Good          | Good        |
| Learning Curve     | Moderate                      | Easy                  | Steep         | Moderate    |
| Mobile Testing     | Emulation                     | Viewport only         | Real devices  | Emulation   |

**Decision**: Playwright selected for superior browser coverage and built-in features

### Browser Coverage Strategy

#### Primary Browsers (P0)

- **Chrome/Chromium**: 65% market share, PWA support
- **Safari/WebKit**: 19% market share, iOS testing
- **Firefox**: 3% market share, standards compliance

#### Secondary Browsers (P1)

- **Edge**: Chromium-based, enterprise users
- **Mobile Chrome**: Android devices
- **Mobile Safari**: iOS devices

### PWA Testing Requirements

#### Installation Flow

1. Check manifest.json availability
2. Verify service worker registration
3. Test beforeinstallprompt event
4. Validate standalone mode
5. Test app shortcuts

#### Offline Functionality

1. Cache first load assets
2. Navigate while offline
3. Submit forms with background sync
4. Show offline indicators
5. Restore when online

### Performance Benchmarks

#### Target Metrics

- **Test Execution**: < 5 minutes locally
- **CI Pipeline**: < 10 minutes total
- **Parallel Workers**: 4 max (CI constraint)
- **Retry Strategy**: 2 retries on failure
- **Timeout**: 30s per test, 5min total

#### Resource Requirements

- **Docker Image**: ~1.5GB (with browsers)
- **CI Minutes**: ~300/month estimated
- **Storage**: ~500MB for artifacts
- **Memory**: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

- Playwright installation and configuration
- Basic homepage and navigation tests
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Docker integration

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)

- Theme switching (all 32 themes)
- Form validation and submission
- Component interaction tests
- Cross-browser validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)

- PWA installation flow
- Offline mode testing
- Accessibility validation
- Performance metrics

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 4)

- Report generation
- Flaky test fixes
- Documentation
- Team training

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **Flaky Tests**: Mitigate with proper waits and retries
2. **Browser Updates**: Use fixed versions in CI
3. **CI Costs**: Monitor usage, optimize parallelization
4. **Docker Size**: Use multi-stage builds

### Organizational Risks

1. **Learning Curve**: Provide examples and documentation
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Use Page Object Model
3. **Test Duplication**: Clear boundaries with unit tests
4. **False Positives**: Implement smart retries

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required Packages

```json
{
  "@playwright/test": "^1.49.0"
}
```

### System Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (already satisfied)
- Docker 20+ (for CI)
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 5GB disk space (with browsers)

### CI Requirements

- GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest
- Artifact storage for reports
- Secret management for URLs
- Matrix strategy for browsers

## Research Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **Playwright is optimal** for cross-browser E2E testing
2. **Page Object Model** essential for maintainability
3. **Docker integration** critical for CI consistency
4. **Parallel execution** necessary for performance
5. **Selective testing** reduces execution time

### Recommended Approach

1. Start with critical happy paths
2. Add edge cases incrementally
3. Focus on user journeys, not implementation
4. Maintain test independence
5. Prioritize stability over coverage

### Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: 10+ critical user journeys
- **Reliability**: <1% flaky test rate
- **Performance**: <5 min execution time
- **Browsers**: 3+ browsers tested
- **Maintenance**: <2 hours/week

## Next Steps

✅ Research complete - no unknowns remaining
→ Proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts
→ Generate data models and API contracts
→ Create quickstart guide for team
