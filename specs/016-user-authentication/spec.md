- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

- Q: When unverified users try to access payment features, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Redirect to email verification page with retry option
- Q: What is the maximum expected concurrent user session count for capacity planning? ‚Üí A: 100-1,000 users (small business scale)
- Q: When the email delivery service fails (verification/reset emails), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show error immediately and require manual retry
- Q: What authentication events should be logged for security auditing? ‚Üí A: All auth events including token refresh, password changes (comprehensive)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user of ScriptHammer's payment system, I need to create an account and authenticate securely so that I can make payments and view my payment history without anyone else being able to access my financial information.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: New User Registration

1. **Given** I am a new user visiting the payment page, **When** I click "Sign Up", **Then** I am presented with a registration form
2. **Given** I fill in my email and a strong password, **When** I submit the form, **Then** my account is created and I receive a verification email
3. **Given** I receive the verification email, **When** I click the verification link, **Then** my email is confirmed and I can sign in

#### Scenario 2: Existing User Login

1. **Given** I have a verified account, **When** I enter my correct email and password, **Then** I am signed in and redirected to my dashboard
2. **Given** I am signing in, **When** I check the "Remember Me" option, **Then** my session remains active for 30 days
3. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I navigate to payment history, **Then** I see only MY payment transactions
4. **Given** I am signed in with "Remember Me", **When** I close my browser and return within 30 days, **Then** my session is still active

#### Scenario 3: Password Reset

1. **Given** I forgot my password, **When** I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email, **Then** I receive a password reset link
2. **Given** I receive the reset link, **When** I click it and enter a new password, **Then** my password is updated and I can sign in with the new password

#### Scenario 4: Third-Party Authentication

1. **Given** I prefer not to create another password, **When** I click "Sign in with GitHub", **Then** I am redirected to GitHub to authorize
2. **Given** I authorize the application on GitHub, **When** I return to ScriptHammer, **Then** I am automatically signed in

#### Scenario 5: Protected Content Access

1. **Given** I am NOT signed in, **When** I try to access the payment demo page, **Then** I am redirected to the sign-in page
2. **Given** I am signed in, **When** I access the payment demo page, **Then** I can make payments and view my history

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to sign up with an email that already exists?
  ‚Üí System shows error: "Email already registered. Please sign in or reset password."

- How does the system handle expired verification links?
  ‚Üí System shows error and provides option to resend verification email

- What happens when email delivery fails for verification or password reset?
  ‚Üí System shows error immediately with message: "Failed to send email. Please try again." and provides manual retry button

- What happens when an unverified user tries to access payment features?
  ‚Üí System redirects to email verification page with message: "Please verify your email to access payment features" and provides resend verification button

- What happens when a user's session expires while they're viewing payment history?
  ‚Üí System redirects to sign-in page with message: "Session expired. Please sign in again."

- How does the system prevent brute force password attacks?
  ‚Üí System limits login attempts to 5 per 15 minutes per email address

- What happens when a user tries to access someone else's payment data?
  ‚Üí System returns empty results (database RLS policies prevent unauthorized access)

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies

- Payment integration (PRP-015) is already deployed and functional
- Database schema includes auth.users table with RLS policies configured
- Email delivery service is available for verification and password reset emails (failures handled with immediate error and manual retry)
- OAuth applications are registered with GitHub and Google

### Assumptions

- Users have access to their email to verify accounts
- Users understand OAuth and trust GitHub/Google for authentication
- Static site deployment (GitHub Pages) can integrate with external authentication service
- Supabase Auth service is reliable and meets uptime requirements

### Known Constraints

- Authentication must be production-ready (no shortcuts or temporary solutions)
- Must comply with PCI requirements for payment processing
- Must comply with GDPR for user data protection
- All security vulnerabilities in PRP-015 must be resolved before production deployment

### Performance & Scale Targets

- **Concurrent Users**: System MUST support 100-1,000 concurrent authenticated sessions
- **Session Management**: Authentication service MUST handle small business scale (100-1,000 users)

### Observability & Auditing

- **Security Audit Logging**: System MUST log all authentication events including:
  - User sign-up and email verification
  - Successful and failed login attempts
  - Password changes and reset requests
  - Token refresh operations
  - User logout events
  - Account deletion events
- **Log Retention**: Authentication audit logs MUST be retained for compliance review
- **Privacy Compliance**: Logs MUST NOT contain passwords or sensitive credentials, only event metadata
