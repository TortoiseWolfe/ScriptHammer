# Tasks: User Authentication & Authorization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/016-user-authentication/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Summary

Implement production-ready authentication system using Supabase Auth with email/password, OAuth (GitHub/Google), email verification, password reset, session management, and comprehensive audit logging. Integrate with existing payment system to replace hardcoded user IDs with authenticated sessions.

**Total Tasks**: 78
**Estimated Duration**: 10-12 days
**TDD Approach**: Tests before implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Configuration (T001-T008)

- [ ] T062 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/sign-in-flow.test.ts (full sign-in journey: form → API → session created → redirect)
- [ ] T063 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/password-reset-flow.test.ts (forgot password → email → reset form → password updated)
- [ ] T064 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/oauth-flow.test.ts (OAuth button → provider redirect → callback → session created)
- [ ] T065 [P] Create tests/integration/auth/protected-routes.test.ts (middleware blocks unauth users, allows auth users)

## Phase 3.10: E2E Tests (Playwright)

## Validation Checklist

**Gate: Verify before marking tasks.md complete**

- [x] All contracts (auth-api.yaml, profile-api.yaml) have corresponding contract tests (T013-T020)
- [x] All entities (user_profiles, auth_audit_logs) have migration tasks (T008-T012)
- [x] All components follow 5-file pattern via generator (T030-T039)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T013-T020 before T040-T049, T061-T065 before polish)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path or command
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD phases clearly marked (contract tests T013-T020, integration tests T061-T065, E2E tests T066-T068)
- [x] All 28 functional requirements from spec.md covered by tasks
- [x] All 5 user scenarios from spec.md have corresponding E2E tests

## Success Criteria (from spec.md)

**Functional Requirements**: All 28 FRs implemented via tasks above
**Performance**: 100-1,000 concurrent sessions (validated in T066-T068)
**Security**: Audit logging (T024), rate limiting (T023), RLS enforcement (T012, T067)
**Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance (T069-T070)
**Testing**: Contract tests (T013-T020), integration tests (T061-T065), E2E tests (T066-T068)

## Notes

- **TDD Approach**: All tests written before implementation (contract tests → utilities → integration tests → E2E tests)
- **Component Generation**: NEVER create components manually - always use generator (T030-T039)
- **Commit Frequency**: Commit after each task completion
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks marked [P] can run simultaneously if using multiple terminals or automated task runner
- **Known Issues**: See docs/testing/KNOWN-TEST-ISSUES.md for any test timing issues (none expected for auth)
- **Quickstart Validation**: Execute quickstart.md steps after T068 to manually verify primary user journey
