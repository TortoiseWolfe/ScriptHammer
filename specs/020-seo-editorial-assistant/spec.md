## 1. Product Requirements

### What We're Building

An SEO Editorial Assistant that integrates with the blog editor to provide real-time SEO analysis and content optimization suggestions. The system must support editing existing markdown blog posts, analyzing their SEO performance, and exporting bundles of posts as ZIP files for email-based workflows. Developers can then unzip these bundles directly into the repository's `/blog` folder.

### Why We're Building It

- **GitHub Pages Limitation**: The one-way nature of GitHub Pages deployment requires a round-trip workflow for content updates
- **Content Quality**: Blog posts need SEO optimization to improve discoverability and readability
- **Automation Support**: Terminal-friendly output enables CI/CD integration and automated content workflows
- **Editorial Workflow**: Content creators need to edit, analyze, and bundle posts for developer review
- **October Content**: Existing October blog posts need SEO analysis and optimization

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Blog editor can load and edit existing markdown files from `/blog` directory
- [ ] Real-time SEO analysis during editing (Flesch readability, keyword density, technical SEO)
- [ ] SEO score with traffic light indicators (red/yellow/green)
- [ ] Export selected posts as ZIP bundle with SEO reports
- [ ] Import ZIP bundles back to `/blog` directory preserving structure
- [ ] Terminal-friendly output for automation workflows
- [ ] Support for both new posts and updates to existing posts
- [ ] Manifest file tracking changes in each bundle
- [ ] /editorial slash command for quick SEO analysis

### Out of Scope

- Direct git commits from the editor
- Database storage of blog posts (keep markdown files)
- Automated email sending (manual attachment for now)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Version control within the editor

## 2. Context & Codebase Intelligence
