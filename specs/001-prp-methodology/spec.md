# Feature Specification: PRP Methodology & SpecKit Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-prp-methodology`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "PRP Methodology & SpecKit Integration - document how to convert Product Requirements Prompts into executable features using SpecKit workflow"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Documentation system for PRP ‚Üí SpecKit workflow
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, template users
   ‚Üí Actions: write PRPs, run SpecKit commands, implement features
   ‚Üí Data: PRP documents, SpecKit artifacts, workflow documentation
   ‚Üí Constraints: must integrate with existing 12 completed PRPs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clear - comprehensive PRP written
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: Developer writes PRP, feeds into SpecKit, implements feature
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable via documentation completeness
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí PRP Document, SpecKit Spec, Plan, Tasks, Implementation
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details (pure documentation)
   ‚Üí Ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A developer wants to add Visual Regression Testing (PRP-012) to ScriptHammer. They need a clear, repeatable process that takes them from a product idea (PRP) through to tested, production-ready code using the SpecKit workflow commands.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has a product requirement (PRP-012: Visual Regression Testing), **When** they follow the documented PRP ‚Üí SpecKit workflow, **Then** they can successfully:
   - Write a structured PRP document
   - Convert it to a SpecKit specification using `/specify`
   - Generate an implementation plan using `/plan`
   - Break it into tasks using `/tasks`
   - Execute the tasks using `/implement`

2. **Given** a new contributor forks ScriptHammer, **When** they want to add a custom feature, **Then** they can read the PRP Methodology documentation and understand:
   - What PRPs are and when to use them
   - How PRPs differ from SpecKit specs
   - The complete workflow from idea to implementation
   - Real examples from completed PRPs (002-014)

3. **Given** PRP-012 (Visual Regression) is ready to implement, **When** a developer runs the documented workflow, **Then** they can complete the feature following the exact same process that worked for PRPs 002-014

4. **Given** a developer is mid-implementation, **When** they need to reference the workflow, **Then** they can access a quick reference guide showing:
   - Command sequence (specify ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí implement)
   - What each command does
   - What artifacts get generated
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a PRP is too vague for SpecKit to process? ‚Üí Use `/clarify` to identify gaps
- How does the system handle deviations from the plan during implementation? ‚Üí Update plan.md and tasks.md as needed
- What if a feature doesn't fit the PRP format? ‚Üí Small changes and bug fixes can skip this workflow
- How do developers know when to use the full workflow vs. quick fixes? ‚Üí Documentation includes decision tree

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide comprehensive documentation explaining what PRPs are and why they're used in ScriptHammer
- **FR-002**: System MUST document the complete PRP ‚Üí SpecKit workflow with step-by-step instructions
- **FR-003**: System MUST show real examples from at least 2-3 completed PRPs demonstrating the workflow
- **FR-004**: System MUST explain how to write effective PRPs (structure, content, level of detail)
- **FR-005**: System MUST document all four SpecKit commands (`/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`) and their purposes
- **FR-006**: System MUST explain what artifacts each SpecKit command generates
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a quick reference guide for common scenarios
- **FR-008**: System MUST document when to use the full workflow vs. simpler approaches
- **FR-009**: System MUST explain how PRPs integrate with the existing `prp-to-feature.sh` script
- **FR-010**: System MUST include validation checklists for each phase of the workflow
- **FR-011**: System MUST document common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- **FR-012**: System MUST update existing PRP-WORKFLOW.md to include SpecKit integration
- **FR-013**: System MUST be usable by someone unfamiliar with either PRPs or SpecKit

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Documentation MUST be clear enough for new contributors to follow without assistance
- **NFR-002**: Examples MUST use real, completed PRPs from the codebase (no hypotheticals)
- **NFR-003**: Quick reference guide MUST fit on a single page/screen
- **NFR-004**: Workflow documentation MUST be discoverable (linked from CLAUDE.md and README)
- **NFR-005**: Documentation MUST demonstrate the workflow by using it (dogfooding - PRP-001 goes through SpecKit)

### Key Entities

- **PRP Document**: Product Requirements Prompt with 7-section structure (What, Why, Context, Technical Specs, Runbook, Validation, References)
- **SpecKit Specification**: Generated by `/specify` command, contains User Scenarios (Given/When/Then), Functional Requirements, Key Entities
- **Implementation Plan**: Generated by `/plan` command, contains architecture, tech stack, file structure, implementation phases
- **Design Artifacts**: Generated by `/plan` - research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
- **Task List**: Generated by `/tasks` command, numbered tasks with dependencies and parallel execution markers [P]
- **Implementation**: Executed by `/implement` or manually, following TDD approach

### Success Metrics

- **SM-001**: PRP-012 (Visual Regression) can be implemented following this documentation without external guidance
- **SM-002**: New contributors can understand and use the PRP/SpecKit workflow within 1 hour of reading documentation
- **SM-003**: At least 2 real PRP examples are documented showing before/after SpecKit conversion
- **SM-004**: Quick reference guide exists and is linked from main documentation

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (this is documentation, not code)
- [x] Focused on user value (enables repeatable feature development)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (product managers, new developers)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable (documentation completeness can be verified)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (can PRP-012 be completed using this?)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (documentation only, not changing SpecKit itself)

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

- Documentation of PRP structure and purpose
- Step-by-step workflow: PRP ‚Üí SpecKit ‚Üí Implementation
- Real examples from completed PRPs (002, 010, 013, 014)
- Quick reference guide
- Integration with existing `prp-to-feature.sh` script
- Updates to PRP-WORKFLOW.md
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### Out of Scope

- Modifying SpecKit itself (upstream tool)
- Changing PRP format or structure
- Alternative methodologies (Shape Up, Scrum, etc.)
- Project management tooling
- AI code generation features

### Dependencies

- Existing 12 completed PRPs (002-014)
- SpecKit slash commands (`.claude/commands/`)
- `prp-to-feature.sh` script
- SpecKit templates (`.specify/templates/`)

### Assumptions

- SpecKit commands are functional and stable
- Existing PRPs followed a consistent pattern
- Developers have access to the codebase and Docker environment
- Claude Code CLI is available for slash commands

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Documentation becomes outdated as SpecKit evolves
**Mitigation**: Document the workflow as it exists today (SpecKit templates visible in codebase), note that SpecKit is external

**Risk**: PRP-001 itself goes through SpecKit, creating circular documentation
**Mitigation**: This is intentional (dogfooding) - demonstrates the workflow by using it

**Risk**: Workflow feels heavyweight for small features
**Mitigation**: Include section on when to use full workflow vs. quick fixes

**Risk**: New users confused by PRP format vs. SpecKit format
**Mitigation**: Clear side-by-side comparison showing conversion
