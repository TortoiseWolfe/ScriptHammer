# Feature Specification: Fix Docker .next Permissions

**Feature Branch**: `017-fix-docker-next`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fix-docker-next-permissions"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Fixing Docker permission issues with .next directory
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: Docker containers, .next directory, file permissions, development workflow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All aspects clear from existing documentation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Developer workflow defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Docker container, host filesystem, .next directory
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All requirements clear and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer working with the CRUDkit template, I need to be able to use Docker for development without encountering permission errors with the .next build directory, so that I can maintain a consistent development workflow without manual interventions or workarounds.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a fresh clone of the repository, **When** I run `docker compose up`, **Then** the development server starts without permission errors
2. **Given** a running Docker container, **When** I make code changes that trigger a rebuild, **Then** the .next directory updates without permission conflicts
3. **Given** a stopped container, **When** I restart it with `docker compose restart`, **Then** the server starts without requiring manual cleanup
4. **Given** a project with new dependencies, **When** I install them in the container, **Then** the application continues to run without permission issues
5. **Given** multiple developers on different systems, **When** they each run the Docker setup, **Then** all experience consistent behavior regardless of host OS or user permissions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when switching between Docker and local development?
  � System must handle gracefully without conflicts
- How does system handle corrupted .next directory?
  � Must provide automatic recovery mechanism
- What happens when host user ID differs from container user ID?
  � Must work regardless of host user configuration
- How does system handle when .next exists on host with wrong permissions?
  � Must automatically correct or bypass the issue

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST prevent .next directory permission conflicts between Docker container and host filesystem
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow developers to start Docker containers without manual permission fixes
- **FR-003**: Container MUST be able to write to .next directory during development and build processes
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain hot-reload functionality for development
- **FR-005**: Solution MUST work across container restarts without manual intervention
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle transitions between Docker and local development gracefully
- **FR-007**: Solution MUST NOT require sudo privileges for normal operation
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages if permission issues occur
- **FR-009**: Solution MUST work consistently across different host operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL2)
- **FR-010**: System MUST NOT degrade development performance significantly

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Solution must be transparent to developers after initial setup
- **NFR-002**: Must not require changes to Next.js application code
- **NFR-003**: Must be documented clearly for new developers
- **NFR-004**: Must not break existing CI/CD pipelines

### Key Entities

- **Docker Container**: The isolated environment running the Next.js application with node user permissions
- **Host Filesystem**: The developer's local machine filesystem where source code resides
- **.next Directory**: Next.js build cache directory that causes permission conflicts
- **Volume Mount**: The Docker mechanism that shares files between host and container
