| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Nominatim rate limits   | Search fails        | Implement caching, queue requests     |
| GPS drains battery      | Users disable       | Smart tracking, pause when stationary |
| Privacy concerns        | Low adoption        | Clear consent, local-only storage     |
| VPN causes confusion    | Wrong location      | Prominent manual options              |
| Browser incompatibility | Feature unavailable | Progressive enhancement               |
