## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a mobile user visiting ScriptHammer on my phone, I want the site to provide a clean, native-feeling mobile experience where all content is readable, all controls are tappable, and nothing requires horizontal scrolling or zooming, so that I can easily navigate and consume content on my device.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage on a 320px wide device (iPhone SE),
   **When** they view the page,
   **Then** the navigation header fits within the viewport with no horizontal scroll and all interactive elements are tappable

2. **Given** a user is reading a blog post on a 390px wide device (iPhone 12),
   **When** they scroll through the content,
   **Then** text is comfortably readable without zooming, code blocks scroll internally, and images fit within the viewport

3. **Given** a user taps on navigation controls on a 375px wide device,
   **When** they interact with buttons (theme selector, font controls, etc.),
   **Then** all touch targets are at least 44x44px and adequately spaced for accurate tapping

4. **Given** a user views any page at any mobile width (320px-428px),
   **When** they load the page,
   **Then** there is zero horizontal scroll across the entire page

5. **Given** a mobile user views the site compared to desktop,
   **When** observing the layouts,
   **Then** mobile layouts are purpose-built for mobile (not just scaled-down desktop)

### Edge Cases

**Narrow Devices (320px)**:

- Navigation buttons shrink proportionally to fit all controls within viewport
- All controls remain visible (no hiding in hamburger menu)

**Very Long Content**:

- Code blocks scroll internally with overflow-x: auto
- Page maintains zero horizontal scroll regardless of code block width

**Touch Target Conflicts**:

- Minimum 44x44px touch targets maintained through button sizing
- Minimum 8px spacing between controls preserved

**Font Size Extremes**:

- Font sizes capped at "large" maximum on screens <375px
- Prevents x-large selection from breaking narrow layouts
- Users on wider screens can still select x-large

**Orientation Changes**:

- Landscape mobile orientation uses mobile breakpoints and styles
- Physical device type determines UI mode, not just width
- Example: iPhone 12 rotated to 844x390 landscape stays in mobile mode

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: When navigation controls don't fit at 320px width, how should the system adapt? ‚Üí A: Shrink all control buttons further to fit (all controls remain visible)
- Q: If space constraints require hiding controls, what's the priority order? ‚Üí A: All controls should show - no hiding required with proper button sizing
- Q: Should there be maximum font sizes on screens <375px to prevent layout breaks? ‚Üí A: Yes - cap at large (not x-large) on <375px screens
- Q: When user rotates device to landscape (e.g., 844px x 390px), use mobile or tablet breakpoints? ‚Üí A: Detect orientation and use mobile styles in landscape mode
- Q: Should there be a minimum supported mobile width below 320px? ‚Üí A: No - 320px is the floor, narrower devices get degraded experience
- Q: Should there be specific image size/format requirements for mobile? ‚Üí A: Yes - responsive srcset required with multiple sizes, modern formats (WebP/AVIF preferred)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Navigation & Header**:

- **FR-001**: System MUST display navigation header that fits within viewport at all mobile widths (320px-428px) without horizontal scroll by shrinking control buttons proportionally while maintaining all controls visible
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide accessible navigation controls (hamburger menu, logo, essential buttons) on all mobile devices with all controls remaining visible (no hiding)
- **FR-003**: Interactive elements in navigation MUST meet 44x44px minimum touch target size (Apple HIG standard) even when shrunk for narrow viewports
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide adequate spacing (minimum 8px) between tappable navigation controls

**Typography & Readability**:

- **FR-005**: System MUST display body text at minimum 16px font size on mobile for comfortable reading without zoom
- **FR-005a**: System MUST cap user-selectable font sizes at "large" maximum on screens <375px to prevent layout breaks (x-large option disabled)
- **FR-006**: System MUST apply line-height of at least 1.5 for all body text and list content
- **FR-007**: System MUST scale heading sizes appropriately for mobile (maintaining visual hierarchy)
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure text content remains readable across all mobile widths without horizontal scroll

**Layout & Components**:

- **FR-009**: System MUST eliminate all horizontal scroll across all pages at mobile widths (320px-428px)
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure images fit within mobile viewport without overflow using responsive srcset with multiple sizes
- **FR-010a**: System MUST serve images in modern formats (WebP preferred, AVIF supported, with fallbacks)
- **FR-011**: System MUST contain code blocks with internal scrolling (overflow-x: auto) preventing page-wide overflow
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide responsive card/grid layouts that reflow for vertical mobile scrolling
- **FR-013**: System MUST apply appropriate padding and margins for touch-friendly mobile spacing

**Mobile-First Approach**:

- **FR-014**: System MUST be designed and built starting from mobile viewport (320px) and progressively enhanced for larger screens
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide distinct mobile layouts (not just scaled desktop layouts)
- **FR-016**: System MUST test all changes at mobile viewport first before desktop verification

**Interaction & Performance**:

- **FR-017**: All interactive elements MUST be accessible via touch with minimum 44x44px tap targets
- **FR-018**: System MUST NOT rely on hover states for essential interactions (mobile has no hover)
- **FR-019**: System MUST maintain Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) below 0.1 on mobile
- **FR-020**: System MUST load efficiently on mobile networks (3G/4G)

**Testing & Quality**:

- **FR-021**: System MUST include automated tests that detect horizontal scroll violations on mobile
- **FR-022**: System MUST include automated tests that validate touch target sizes
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide visual regression baselines for mobile layouts
- **FR-024**: System MUST test across multiple mobile widths: 320px (iPhone SE), 375px (iPhone 13 Mini), 390px (iPhone 12/13/14), 428px (iPhone 14 Pro Max)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001a**: System MUST detect device orientation and maintain mobile styles/breakpoints when mobile devices are in landscape mode (physical device type determines UI mode, not viewport width alone)
- **NFR-002**: Design decisions MUST start from mobile-first principles
- **NFR-003**: Minimum supported mobile width is 320px; devices with narrower screens receive degraded experience (no explicit support below 320px)

**Accessibility**:
