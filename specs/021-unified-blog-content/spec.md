# Feature Specification: Unified Blog Content Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `021-unified-blog-content`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Unified Blog Content Pipeline: Refactor the dual-system blog architecture (markdown files + IndexedDB) into a single, type-safe content pipeline using Content Collections or enhanced markdown processing. The system must maintain offline-first capabilities while eliminating manual build steps, providing automatic file watching, hot reload in development, and bi-directional sync between static content and IndexedDB for offline editing. Key requirements include Zod validation for frontmatter, unified remark/rehype processing pipeline for syntax highlighting and TOC generation, proper caching with incremental builds, conflict resolution for concurrent edits, and a migration path for existing 50+ blog posts without data loss."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: Should table of contents generation be always on, optional per post, based on word count, or never automatic? → A: Optional per post via frontmatter flag
- Q: How should conflicts be resolved - last-write-wins, manual merge UI, version branching, or lock-based? → A: Manual three-way merge with UI showing differences
- Q: When storage quota is exceeded, should system prevent saves, auto-compress, auto-delete, or hybrid approach? → A: Hybrid: Compress first, then warn before deletion

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a content creator, I need a unified blog system that allows me to write and edit blog posts both online and offline, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored, without requiring manual build steps or data regeneration.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer editing blog content in markdown files, **When** they save changes, **Then** the changes should automatically reflect in the development environment without manual regeneration
2. **Given** a user editing a blog post offline in the browser, **When** internet connectivity is restored, **Then** the offline changes should synchronize with the main content source without conflicts
3. **Given** concurrent edits to the same blog post from different sources, **When** synchronization occurs, **Then** the system should detect conflicts and provide resolution options
4. **Given** an existing blog with 50+ posts in markdown format, **When** the migration runs, **Then** all posts should be preserved with their metadata intact
5. **Given** a blog post with code blocks and special formatting with showToc flag enabled, **When** rendered in the browser, **Then** syntax highlighting and table of contents should be automatically generated

### Edge Cases

- What happens when storage quota is exceeded during offline editing? System will compress content first, then warn user before any deletions
- How does system handle malformed frontmatter in markdown files?
- What happens when two users edit the same post offline and sync at different times? Three-way merge UI will appear
- How does the system handle very large blog posts (>100KB)?
- What happens if migration fails partway through processing posts?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single source of truth for blog content accessible by both build-time and runtime processes
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect and process changes to markdown files without manual intervention
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain full offline editing capabilities with local storage
- **FR-004**: System MUST synchronize offline edits with the main content source when connectivity is available
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate all blog post metadata against defined schemas
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate syntax highlighting for code blocks in blog posts
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically generate table of contents for blog posts when the showToc frontmatter flag is set to true
- **FR-008**: System MUST support incremental builds to process only changed content
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide conflict detection when the same content is modified from multiple sources
- **FR-010**: System MUST offer manual three-way merge conflict resolution with a UI showing differences between versions
- **FR-011**: System MUST migrate all existing blog posts without data loss
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing blog URLs and slugs
- **FR-013**: System MUST cache processed content for performance optimization
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide hot reload capability in development environment
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle storage quota limitations by first attempting compression, then warning users before any content deletion

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Blog Post**: Represents a single article with content, metadata (title, author, date, tags, categories), and processing state
- **Post Metadata**: Structured information about a post including publication status, timestamps, categorization, and display preferences (showToc)
- **Sync Queue**: Collection of pending changes waiting for synchronization between offline and online states
- **Content Version**: Represents a specific version of a post to support conflict resolution with base, local, and remote versions for three-way merge
- **Processing Cache**: Temporary storage of processed content (HTML, TOC, etc.) for performance
- **Storage Quota**: Tracks usage and manages compression/cleanup when limits are approached
