## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03

- Q: How should the system notify template users about payment events (successful payments, subscription failures, etc.)? ‚Üí A: Both email AND dashboard (dual notification)
- Q: What are the expected payment volume and scale requirements for the system? ‚Üí A: Medium business (‚â§10,000 payments/month, ‚â§500 concurrent customers)
- Q: What happens when a customer declines the payment provider consent modal (GDPR)? ‚Üí A: Show Cash App/Chime links (no external scripts) on current visit, then retry consent modal next time
- Q: What are the webhook retry and timeout limits for handling payment provider notifications? ‚Üí A: Match provider defaults (Stripe: 3 days, exponential backoff)
- Q: What should happen when Supabase (the backend) is temporarily unavailable? ‚Üí A: Queue operations client-side, sync when Supabase returns (offline-first)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a **template user** (website owner), I want to **accept payments from customers** so that I can **monetize my static website through donations, product sales, or subscriptions** without managing payment infrastructure.

As a **customer/donor**, I want to **pay securely using my preferred payment method** (credit card via Stripe, PayPal, Cash App, or Chime) so that I can **support the website or purchase products**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a template user has configured payment providers, **When** a customer clicks "Donate $10", **Then** the customer is redirected to a secure payment page where they complete payment, and the template user receives confirmation

2. **Given** a customer completes a payment on Stripe, **When** Stripe sends payment confirmation, **Then** the system records the payment with verified status and notifies the template user

3. **Given** a template user wants monthly recurring revenue, **When** a customer subscribes for $5/month, **Then** the system automatically charges the customer monthly and notifies on successful/failed charges

4. **Given** a subscription payment fails, **When** the retry schedule is triggered, **Then** the system attempts payment again on days 1, 3, and 7 after failure before entering grace period

5. **Given** a customer has privacy concerns, **When** payment scripts need to load, **Then** the system shows a consent modal explaining data usage before loading any payment provider code

6. **Given** a template user receives multiple payments, **When** they view payment history, **Then** they can see all transactions with dates, amounts, statuses, and provider information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a webhook is delivered multiple times (duplicate event)?
  ‚Üí System must detect duplicates and process each event exactly once

- How does the system handle failed subscription payments?
  ‚Üí System retries on scheduled intervals, enters grace period after max retries, then cancels if grace period expires

- What happens if a customer closes the payment page without completing?
  ‚Üí System marks payment as canceled and allows customer to retry

- How does the system handle concurrent payments from the same customer?
  ‚Üí Each payment intent is independent with unique transaction ID

- What happens when payment provider (Stripe/PayPal) is temporarily unavailable?
  ‚Üí System provides clear error message and suggests alternative payment method

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Payment Processing:**

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept one-time payments through Stripe (credit card)
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept one-time payments through PayPal
- **FR-003**: System MUST support recurring subscription payments (monthly and yearly intervals)
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate payment amounts against configured minimum ($1.00) and maximum ($999.99) limits
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide direct payment links for Cash App ($cashtag) and Chime ($chimesign)

**Payment Confirmation:**

- **FR-007**: System MUST verify payment completion through secure webhook notifications from payment providers
- **FR-008**: System MUST check webhook signatures to prevent fraudulent notifications
- **FR-009**: System MUST store payment records with status (pending, succeeded, failed)
- **FR-010**: System MUST mark payments as "verified" only after webhook confirmation
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent duplicate processing of the same webhook event (idempotency)

**Subscription Management:**

- **FR-012**: System MUST track active subscriptions with next billing date
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle failed subscription payments with automatic retry attempts
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement configurable retry schedule (default: retry on days 1, 3, 7 after failure)
- **FR-015**: System MUST enter grace period after exhausting retries (default: 7 days)
- **FR-016**: System MUST automatically cancel subscriptions after grace period expires without payment
- **FR-017**: System MUST notify template user of subscription status changes (created, failed, canceled) via both email and in-app dashboard

**Privacy & Consent:**

- **FR-018**: System MUST request user consent before loading payment provider scripts (GDPR compliance)
- **FR-019**: System MUST clearly explain what data is collected and by whom in consent modal
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow users to decline consent and immediately show Cash App and Chime payment links (which require no external scripts) as fallback options
- **FR-036**: System MUST retry consent modal on customer's next visit if previously declined

**Payment History:**

- **FR-021**: System MUST store transaction history including: date, amount, currency, provider, status
- **FR-022**: System MUST maintain audit trail of all payment-related events
- **FR-023**: System MUST allow template users to query payment status by transaction ID

**Template User Configuration:**

- **FR-025**: System MUST support configuration via environment variables (no code changes required)
- **FR-026**: System MUST validate payment provider credentials when Edge Functions initialize (first invocation after deployment). Invalid credentials cause webhook handlers to return 500 error with diagnostic message in Supabase logs

- **FR-028**: System MUST allow template users to enable/disable specific payment providers
- **FR-029**: System MUST set sensible defaults for payment limits, retry schedules, and grace periods

**Error Handling:**

- **FR-030**: System MUST provide user-friendly error messages when payments fail
- **FR-031**: System MUST handle payment provider API errors gracefully by suggesting alternative payment providers (if Stripe unavailable, offer PayPal; if PayPal unavailable, offer Stripe and Cash App/Chime links)
- **FR-032**: System MUST log errors for debugging without exposing sensitive payment data
- **FR-033**: System MUST retry webhook processing on temporary failures using exponential backoff matching provider retry schedules (Stripe: 3 days, PayPal: provider default)
- **FR-037**: System MUST accept and process webhook notifications for the full duration of the provider's retry window (minimum 3 days for Stripe)

- **NFR-004**: System MUST persist queued operations across browser sessions (using IndexedDB or localStorage)
- **NFR-005**: System MUST provide clear UI indicators when operating in offline/queued mode
