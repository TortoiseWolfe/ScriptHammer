## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-25

- Q: When the system encounters markdown files with malformed frontmatter (invalid YAML syntax), how should it behave? → A: Process the post without metadata using defaults
- Q: For blog posts that exceed 100KB in size, what behavior should the system implement? → A: Load full content with lazy loading for images/media
- Q: When social media platforms are blocked or unavailable, how should the sharing buttons behave? → A: Show buttons with visual disabled state
- Q: When a blog post lacks a featured image for social sharing, what should the system use as the fallback? → A: Generate text-based image with post title
- Q: When author social links are broken or accounts are deleted/suspended, how should the system handle these links? → A: Display links as-is without checking

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Stories

1. **Content Creator**: As a blogger, I need to write and edit posts in markdown with automatic hot reload during development, offline editing capabilities, and no manual build steps.

2. **Reader**: As a blog reader, I want to easily share interesting posts on social media and learn about authors through their profiles and social links.

3. **Offline User**: As a user with intermittent connectivity, I need to read and edit blog content offline with automatic synchronization when online.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Content Management

1. **Given** a developer editing blog content in markdown files, **When** they save changes, **Then** the changes should automatically reflect in the development environment without manual regeneration
2. **Given** a user editing a blog post offline in the browser, **When** internet connectivity is restored, **Then** the offline changes should synchronize with the main content source without conflicts
3. **Given** concurrent edits to the same blog post from different sources, **When** synchronization occurs, **Then** the system should detect conflicts and provide resolution options
4. **Given** an existing blog with 50+ posts in markdown format, **When** the migration runs, **Then** all posts should be preserved with their metadata intact
5. **Given** a blog post with code blocks and special formatting with showToc flag enabled, **When** rendered in the browser, **Then** syntax highlighting and table of contents should be automatically generated

#### Social Features

6. **Given** a reader finds a valuable blog post, **When** they click a social sharing button, **Then** the post is shared to their chosen platform with proper title, description, and image
7. **Given** a reader wants to learn more about an author, **When** they view the author profile section, **Then** they see the author's bio and links to their social media accounts
8. **Given** an author publishes a new post, **When** readers share it, **Then** the shared content includes proper metadata for rich social media previews
9. **Given** a reader clicks on an author's social media link, **When** the link opens, **Then** it opens in a new tab/window to maintain blog engagement

### Edge Cases

- What happens when storage quota is exceeded during offline editing? System will compress content first, then warn user before any deletions
- How does system handle malformed frontmatter in markdown files? System will process the post without metadata using defaults and log a warning
- What happens when two users edit the same post offline and sync at different times? Three-way merge UI will appear
- How does the system handle very large blog posts (>100KB)? System will load full content with lazy loading for images/media
- What happens when social media platforms are blocked or unavailable? System will show buttons with visual disabled state
- How does the system handle posts without featured images for social sharing? System will generate text-based image with post title
- What occurs when author social links are broken or accounts are deleted? System will display links as-is without checking
