## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary Security Story

As a user with a ScriptHammer account, I need my payment data and personal information to be completely isolated from other users, protected from unauthorized access, and secured against common web attacks so that my financial information and account cannot be compromised.

### Critical Security Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Payment Data Isolation

1. **Given** I am user Alice with payment history, **When** user Bob signs in, **Then** Bob cannot see or access any of Alice's payment data
2. **Given** I create a payment intent, **When** the system stores it, **Then** it is permanently associated with MY user ID only
3. **Given** I view my payment history, **When** the system queries the database, **Then** only payments belonging to my account are returned

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- No payment data visible across user accounts
- Database queries enforce user isolation
- Payment intent creation requires authenticated user
- RLS policies prevent cross-user data access

#### Scenario 2: OAuth Account Protection

1. **Given** an attacker initiates an OAuth flow, **When** they try to redirect the authorization to a victim's browser, **Then** the victim's account is NOT compromised
2. **Given** I sign in with GitHub, **When** the OAuth callback completes, **Then** the system verifies the request originated from MY browser session
3. **Given** someone tries to replay an OAuth authorization code, **When** they submit it, **Then** the system rejects it as already used or mismatched

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- OAuth sessions cannot be hijacked mid-flow
- Authorization callbacks validate session ownership
- Replay attacks are prevented

#### Scenario 3: Brute Force Attack Prevention

1. **Given** an attacker tries to guess my password, **When** they make 5 failed login attempts, **Then** further attempts are blocked regardless of which browser or device they use
2. **Given** the attacker clears their browser data, **When** they try again, **Then** they are still blocked
3. **Given** I am a legitimate user locked out by rate limiting, **When** I wait the specified time period, **Then** I can try again

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Rate limiting cannot be bypassed by clearing browser storage
- Failed attempts tracked server-side by IP or identifier
- Legitimate users receive clear feedback on lockout duration

#### Scenario 4: Malicious Data Injection Prevention

1. **Given** an attacker creates a payment with malicious metadata, **When** they submit it, **Then** dangerous content is rejected before storage
2. **Given** an attacker tries SQL injection in the email field, **When** they submit it, **Then** the system rejects the invalid input without executing queries
3. **Given** someone submits payment metadata with circular references, **When** the system validates it, **Then** it detects and rejects the invalid structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Prototype pollution attempts blocked
- SQL injection attempts rejected
- XSS attempts in user input sanitized
- Circular reference detection in nested data

### Security Audit Scenarios

#### Scenario 5: Security Event Logging

1. **Given** a user signs in successfully, **When** the authentication completes, **Then** the event is logged with timestamp, user ID, and IP address
2. **Given** someone attempts unauthorized access, **When** the attempt fails, **Then** the failure is logged for security review
3. **Given** an admin reviews security logs, **When** they query recent events, **Then** they see a complete audit trail of authentication activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All authentication events logged (success/failure)
- Logs include sufficient forensic data (IP, user agent, timestamp)
- Logs retained for compliance requirements (90 days minimum)

#### Scenario 6: Session Security

1. **Given** I leave my browser open without activity, **When** 30 minutes pass, **Then** my session expires and I must sign in again
2. **Given** I am signed in with "Remember Me", **When** I perform sensitive operations (payment, profile changes), **Then** the system may require additional verification
3. **Given** my session is active, **When** I explicitly sign out, **Then** my session is completely terminated and cannot be reused

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Idle sessions timeout after configurable period
- Explicit sign-out fully invalidates session
- Session tokens cannot be stolen and replayed

### User Experience Scenarios

#### Scenario 7: Password Security Feedback

1. **Given** I am creating a new password, **When** I type it, **Then** I see real-time feedback on password strength (weak/medium/strong)
2. **Given** my password is too weak, **When** I try to submit, **Then** I see clear requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
3. **Given** I create a strong password, **When** the system validates it, **Then** I receive positive confirmation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Visual strength indicator updates in real-time
- Clear requirements displayed to user
- Feedback helps users create secure passwords

#### Scenario 8: Error Recovery

1. **Given** the OAuth provider is temporarily unavailable, **When** I try to sign in with GitHub, **Then** I see a clear error and can retry or use email/password
2. **Given** email delivery fails during sign-up, **When** the system detects it, **Then** I am notified immediately and can request a new verification email
3. **Given** a payment webhook fails processing, **When** the system retries, **Then** I eventually see the payment status update when it succeeds

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Clear error messages for user-facing failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Users not left in uncertain states

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an attacker submits metadata with `__proto__` key to pollute JavaScript prototypes?
  ‚Üí System detects dangerous keys and rejects the entire request with validation error

- What happens when two users try to create payment intents at the exact same time?
  ‚Üí Each payment is independently associated with the correct user via database constraints

- What happens when email validation service is down during sign-up?
  ‚Üí System shows immediate error, stores partial account, allows retry without re-entering data

- What happens when a webhook is received multiple times for the same event (duplicate delivery)?
  ‚Üí Idempotency key ensures event processed only once, duplicates ignored

- What happens when a user's session expires mid-payment?
  ‚Üí Payment queued offline, user prompted to sign in, payment processed after re-authentication

## Functional Requirements _(mandatory)_

### P0: Critical Security Requirements (Production Blockers)

#### REQ-SEC-001: Payment Data User Isolation

**What**: Every payment intent and transaction must be permanently associated with the specific user who created it, with no possibility of cross-user data access.

**Why**: Without proper user association, payment data can leak between accounts, violating PCI compliance and user privacy. This is a critical data integrity and security violation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Payment intent creation requires authenticated user ID
- Database enforces user ID foreign key constraint
- RLS policies prevent queries from returning other users' data
- Payment history shows only the authenticated user's transactions

**Current Issue**: All payments use placeholder UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

---

#### REQ-SEC-002: OAuth Session Ownership Verification

**What**: OAuth authentication flows must verify that the authorization callback belongs to the browser session that initiated the request.

**Why**: Without session verification, attackers can hijack OAuth flows to gain unauthorized access to victim accounts (CSRF attack).

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- OAuth initiation generates unique session identifier
- Session identifier validated on callback before authentication completes
- Mismatched identifiers rejected with error
- Session identifier expires after use (single-use tokens)

**Current Issue**: No state parameter validation in OAuth callback

---

#### REQ-SEC-003: Server-Side Authentication Rate Limiting

**What**: Failed authentication attempts must be tracked and limited server-side, preventing brute force attacks regardless of client behavior.

**Why**: Client-side rate limiting (localStorage) can be trivially bypassed by clearing browser data, using incognito mode, or switching browsers. Server-side enforcement is required for actual security.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Failed login attempts tracked by IP address or email on server
- Rate limits enforced before authentication attempt reaches database
- Legitimate users see clear feedback on remaining attempts and lockout duration
- Bypass attempts (cleared storage, different browser) still blocked

**Current Issue**: Rate limiting uses localStorage only (client-side)

---

#### REQ-SEC-004: CSRF Protection for State-Changing Operations

**What**: All operations that modify user data (sign-up, profile updates, payments) must include CSRF token validation to prevent cross-site request forgery.

**Why**: Without CSRF protection, attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions via malicious websites.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Sign-up, sign-in, and profile update forms include CSRF tokens
- Payment creation validates request authenticity
- Invalid or missing tokens rejected with 403 Forbidden
- Tokens expire after use or timeout period

**Current Issue**: Forms lack CSRF token validation

---

### P1: High Priority Security Hardening

#### REQ-SEC-005: Metadata Injection Prevention

**What**: Payment metadata must be validated to prevent prototype pollution, circular references, and excessive nesting that could compromise system security or stability.

**Why**: Malicious metadata can pollute JavaScript object prototypes, causing application-wide security vulnerabilities or crashes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Metadata validation rejects keys: `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`
- Circular reference detection prevents infinite loops
- Nesting depth limited to 2 levels maximum
- Array sizes limited to prevent resource exhaustion
- String metadata size limited to 1KB

**Current Issue**: Weak validation allows dangerous patterns

---

#### REQ-SEC-006: Comprehensive Email Validation

**What**: Email addresses must be validated for proper format, valid top-level domain, and optionally blocked if from disposable email services.

**Why**: Invalid or disposable emails prevent account recovery, enable abuse, and reduce user quality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Email validation requires valid TLD (`.com`, `.org`, etc.)
- Consecutive dots (`..`) rejected
- Disposable email domains blocked (configurable list)
- Email normalized to lowercase for consistency
- Local part and domain both required

**Current Issue**: Validation allows emails without TLD

---

#### REQ-SEC-007: Security Event Audit Logging

**What**: All authentication and authorization events must be logged with sufficient detail for security investigations and compliance.

**Why**: Without audit logs, security incidents cannot be investigated, and compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI) are not met.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Events logged: sign-up, sign-in success/failure, sign-out, password changes
- Log data includes: user ID, event type, timestamp, IP address, user agent
- Logs retained for minimum 90 days
- Logs queryable for security review
- Failed authentication attempts prominently logged

**Current Issue**: Audit log table exists but not populated

---

#### REQ-SEC-008: Rate Limiter Initialization Fix

**What**: Authentication rate limiting must be initialized with the correct user identifier (email or IP) rather than empty string.

**Why**: Current implementation creates a shared rate limit key for all users, making the feature ineffective.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Rate limiter initialized after email input provided
- Each email/IP has independent rate limit tracking
- Rate limits not shared across different users
- Test: Two users can each have 5 failed attempts independently

**Current Issue**: Rate limiter initialized with empty email on component mount

---

### P2: Medium Priority Improvements

#### REQ-UX-001: Password Strength Feedback

**What**: Users creating passwords must see real-time visual feedback on password strength (weak, medium, strong) to guide them toward secure choices.

**Why**: Users often choose weak passwords without understanding requirements. Visual feedback improves security awareness and reduces weak passwords.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Strength indicator updates as user types
- Visual bar shows weak (red), medium (yellow), strong (green)
- Clear requirements displayed (length, character types)
- Encouragement for strong passwords without blocking weak ones (education)

---

#### REQ-UX-002: Session Idle Timeout

**What**: User sessions must automatically expire after a configurable period of inactivity (default 30 minutes) to prevent unauthorized access to unattended devices.

**Why**: Users often leave devices unlocked. Idle timeout reduces risk of physical access to accounts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Inactivity timer resets on mouse movement, keyboard input, clicks
- User warned before timeout (1 minute warning)
- Timeout duration configurable (default 30 min)
- "Remember Me" extends initial session but still enforces idle timeout

---

#### REQ-REL-001: OAuth Error Handling

**What**: OAuth authentication failures must be caught by error boundaries and provide clear recovery options to users.

**Why**: Network failures or provider outages during OAuth currently show blank screens, frustrating users.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Error boundary wraps OAuth callback page
- Network/provider errors show friendly message
- "Try Again" button allows retry
- Option to use email/password authentication instead
- Errors logged for debugging

---

#### REQ-REL-002: Webhook Retry Mechanism

**What**: Failed webhook processing attempts must be automatically retried with exponential backoff until success or maximum attempts reached.

**Why**: Transient network failures or temporary downtime can cause payment status to never update. Retries ensure eventual consistency.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Failed webhooks retried up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff between retries (1min, 5min, 30min)
- After max attempts, webhook marked as permanently failed
- Admin can manually trigger retry for failed webhooks
- Idempotency prevents duplicate processing on retry

---

#### REQ-OPS-001: Payment Intent Cleanup

**What**: Payment intents that expire after 24 hours must be automatically removed from the database to prevent unbounded growth.

**Why**: Expired intents serve no purpose and consume database resources over time.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Daily cleanup process runs automatically
- Intents older than 24 hours deleted
- Associated metadata also cleaned up
- Cleanup logs number of records removed
- Cleanup failures do not crash system

---

### P3: Low Priority Polish

#### REQ-POLISH-001: Production Logging Discipline

**What**: Debug console.log statements must be removed from production code or wrapped in development environment checks.

**Why**: Console output exposes system internals to users and can aid attackers in reconnaissance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- No console.log in production builds
- Development logging wrapped in `NODE_ENV === 'development'` checks
- Structured logging for server-side operations
- No sensitive data (tokens, passwords) in logs

---

#### REQ-A11Y-001: Accessible Error Announcements

**What**: Form validation errors must be announced to screen reader users via ARIA live regions.

**Why**: Screen reader users cannot see visual error messages and may not know why form submission failed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Error alerts include `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`
- Error messages clearly state the problem and solution
- Errors announced immediately after validation
- Success messages also announced
