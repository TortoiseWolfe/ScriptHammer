# Research: Component Structure Standardization

## Overview

Research findings for implementing a 4-file component structure standardization across the React/Next.js codebase.

## Key Decisions

### 1. File Structure Pattern

**Decision**: 4-file pattern (index.tsx, Component.tsx, Component.test.tsx, Component.stories.tsx)
**Rationale**:

- Enforces consistency across all components
- Ensures every component has tests and documentation
- Simplifies tooling and automation
- Industry best practice for component organization
  **Alternatives considered**:
- 3-file pattern (no index.tsx): Rejected - barrel exports improve import ergonomics
- 5-file pattern (separate types file): Rejected - over-engineering for most components
- Flat structure: Rejected - doesn't scale well

### 2. Tooling Approach

**Decision**: Node.js scripts with Plop for scaffolding
**Rationale**:

- Zero runtime dependencies
- Works with existing build pipeline
- Simple to maintain and understand
- Plop is mature and widely adopted
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Custom webpack plugin: Rejected - too complex, build-time overhead
- ESLint rules only: Rejected - can't auto-fix structure
- Manual enforcement: Rejected - prone to human error

### 3. Migration Strategy

**Decision**: Automated migration with minimal test stubs
**Rationale**:

- Reduces manual work
- Ensures 100% compliance quickly
- Doesn't break existing functionality
- Provides foundation for future test development
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Manual migration: Rejected - time-consuming, error-prone
- Gradual migration: Rejected - inconsistency period too long
- Full test generation: Rejected - generic tests provide little value

### 4. CI Enforcement

**Decision**: Pre-commit validation with hard failures
**Rationale**:

- Prevents regression
- Immediate feedback to developers
- Maintains compliance automatically
- Low overhead check
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Post-merge checks: Rejected - too late to prevent issues
- Warning only: Rejected - will be ignored
- Manual review: Rejected - doesn't scale

### 5. Component Detection

**Decision**: Directory-based detection with naming convention
**Rationale**:

- Simple and reliable
- Matches existing structure
- Easy to understand
- No false positives
  **Alternatives considered**:
- AST parsing: Rejected - overly complex
- File content analysis: Rejected - unreliable
- Config file listing: Rejected - maintenance burden

## Technical Findings

### Current State Analysis

- Most components have 2-3 files
- Missing files predominantly: index.tsx and test files
- Storybook files present for ~60% of components
- No existing enforcement mechanism

### Performance Considerations

- File system operations are fast (<1ms per component)
- Glob pattern matching efficient for <1000 files
- No runtime impact (build-time only)
- CI check adds <2 seconds to pipeline

### Compatibility Notes

- Works with all Next.js versions
- Compatible with Vitest and Jest
- Storybook 7+ recommended
- Node.js 16+ required for fs.promises

### Best Practices Research

#### Barrel Exports

- Use named exports for types
- Default export for component
- Reduces import churn during refactoring
- Improves tree-shaking

#### Test File Structure

- Describe blocks match component name
- At minimum: render test
- Group by user interaction
- Use Testing Library queries

#### Storybook Organization

- Category matches atomic design level
- Default story always present
- Args documented with JSDoc
- Use CSF 3.0 format

## Implementation Risks

### Risk Assessment

1. **Breaking imports**: LOW - barrel exports maintain compatibility
2. **Merge conflicts**: MEDIUM - coordinate with team
3. **Test failures**: LOW - stub tests won't fail
4. **Build time increase**: LOW - minimal overhead

### Mitigation Strategies

- Run migration during low-activity period
- Communicate changes to team
- Create backups before migration
- Test on subset first

## Dependencies Analysis

### Required npm packages

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "plop": "^4.0.0",
    "glob": "^10.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Existing Dependencies Utilized

- @testing-library/react (existing)
- @storybook/react (existing)
- vitest (existing)
- typescript (existing)

## Validation Approach

### Success Metrics

- 100% component compliance
- Zero runtime errors
- All imports working
- CI validation passing

### Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each script
2. Integration test on sample components
3. Full system test on entire codebase
4. Rollback plan if issues

## Conclusion

All technical questions resolved. Ready to proceed with implementation design phase.

- ✅ File structure pattern defined
- ✅ Tooling approach selected
- ✅ Migration strategy determined
- ✅ CI enforcement planned
- ✅ Performance validated
- ✅ Risks assessed and mitigated
