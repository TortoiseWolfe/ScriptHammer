# Feature Specification: Sprint 3.5 - Technical Debt Reduction

**Feature Branch**: `016-sprint-3-5`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Sprint 3.5: Technical Debt Reduction - Eliminate accumulated technical debt including Next.js 15.5 workarounds, security headers, offline queue test failures, Storybook fixes, PWA manifest generation, and component structure standardization"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Technical debt reduction sprint identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: workarounds, test failures, configuration issues, standardization needs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All items clearly defined in CONSTITUTION.md
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Developer and deployment scenarios created
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � 11 requirements mapped to priority levels
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Not applicable for technical debt
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All items specified without implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the CRUDkit project, I need to eliminate accumulated technical debt so that the codebase is stable, maintainable, and free of workarounds before implementing new features in Sprint 4.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Critical Priority Items

1. **Given** the Next.js 15.5 static export bug is fixed upstream, **When** developers build the project, **Then** the build succeeds without requiring dummy Pages Router files
2. **Given** security headers need to be configured, **When** deploying to production, **Then** clear documentation exists for configuring headers at the hosting level
3. **Given** offline queue integration tests are failing, **When** running the test suite, **Then** all tests pass consistently without timing issues

#### High Priority Items

4. **Given** ContactForm Storybook stories fail, **When** running Storybook, **Then** all component stories render without initialization errors
5. **Given** GoogleAnalytics requires ConsentContext, **When** viewing in Storybook, **Then** the component preview works with proper context
6. **Given** PWA manifest uses API route, **When** building for static export, **Then** manifest is generated at build time
7. **Given** components have inconsistent structure, **When** creating or modifying components, **Then** all follow the 5-file pattern requirement

#### Medium Priority Items

8. **Given** bundle size is ~102KB, **When** analyzing the production build, **Then** First Load JS is reduced to under 90KB
9. **Given** heavy components load synchronously, **When** users access pages with maps/calendars, **Then** components lazy load with loading states
10. **Given** E2E tests run locally only, **When** pushing to GitHub, **Then** E2E tests run automatically in CI
11. **Given** project configuration is complex, **When** building the project, **Then** configuration works without webpack workarounds

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Next.js updates introduce new breaking changes?
- How does system handle new components that don't follow the 5-file pattern?
- What if hosting providers don't support certain security headers?
- How to handle test failures that only occur in CI but not locally?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Critical Requirements (Week 1)

- **FR-001**: System MUST build successfully without dummy Pages Router files when Next.js bug is resolved
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide comprehensive documentation for security header configuration across all major hosting platforms
- **FR-003**: All offline queue integration tests MUST pass consistently without async timing issues

#### High Priority Requirements (Week 1-2)

- **FR-004**: All Storybook stories MUST render successfully without mock initialization errors
- **FR-005**: Components requiring context providers MUST work in Storybook with proper decorators
- **FR-006**: PWA manifest MUST be generated at build time for static export compatibility
- **FR-007**: All components MUST follow the standardized 5-file structure for CI/CD compliance

#### Medium Priority Requirements (Week 2-3)

- **FR-008**: Production bundle size MUST be optimized to under 90KB First Load JS
- **FR-009**: Heavy components (maps, calendars) MUST load dynamically with appropriate loading indicators
- **FR-010**: E2E tests MUST run automatically in GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- **FR-011**: Project configuration MUST work without complex webpack workarounds

### Success Criteria

- No workaround files in the codebase
- 100% of tests passing consistently
- All Storybook stories functional
- Documentation complete for all deployment scenarios
- Bundle size reduced by >10%
- CI/CD pipeline fully automated
