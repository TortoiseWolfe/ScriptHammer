## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Readers want to easily share interesting blog posts with their network and learn more about authors through their social media presence. Authors want to build their online presence and increase content reach through social sharing.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a reader finds a valuable blog post, **When** they click a social sharing button, **Then** the post is shared to their chosen platform with proper title, description, and image
2. **Given** a reader wants to learn more about an author, **When** they view the author profile section, **Then** they see the author's bio and links to their social media accounts
3. **Given** an author publishes a new post, **When** readers share it, **Then** the shared content includes proper metadata for rich social media previews
4. **Given** a user shares a blog post, **When** their followers click the shared link, **Then** they arrive at the full blog post with consistent branding
5. **Given** a reader clicks on an author's social media link, **When** the link opens, **Then** it opens in a new tab/window to maintain blog engagement

### Edge Cases

- What happens when social media platforms are blocked or unavailable?
- How does the system handle posts without featured images for social sharing?
- What occurs when author social links are broken or accounts are deleted?
- How are sharing analytics tracked without compromising user privacy?
