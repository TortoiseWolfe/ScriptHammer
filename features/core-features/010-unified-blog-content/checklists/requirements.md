# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Blog Content Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category                 | Items  | Passed | Status   |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Content Quality          | 4      | 4      | PASS     |
| Requirement Completeness | 8      | 8      | PASS     |
| Feature Readiness        | 4      | 4      | PASS     |
| **Total**                | **16** | **16** | **PASS** |

## Notes

- All 3 clarifications from original feature file have been incorporated into spec
- 26 functional requirements defined across 7 categories
- 10 non-functional requirements defined
- 9 measurable success criteria defined
- 5 prioritized user stories with independent test capabilities
- Edge cases documented for: malformed frontmatter, storage quota, large posts, migration failure, concurrent offline, network interruption

## Next Steps

- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Recommend running `/wireframe` to visualize conflict resolution UI and sync flow
