# Specification Quality Checklist: User Avatar Upload

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 3 clarifications from original feature file have been incorporated into spec
- 27 functional requirements defined across 6 categories
- 9 non-functional requirements defined
- 8 measurable success criteria defined
- 3 prioritized user stories with independent test capabilities
- Edge cases documented for: invalid files, size limits, upload failures, no avatar, collisions, dimensions, storage, abandonment

## Next Steps

- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Recommend running `/wireframe` to visualize upload flow and crop interface
