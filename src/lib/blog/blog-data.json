      "content": "\n# Auto-Configuration: Use Template and Start Building\n\nScriptHammer automatically configures itself based on your new repository. Use this template, and everything adapts to your project name and settings with minimal setup.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Docker and Docker Compose installed (MANDATORY)**\n- Git configured with a remote repository\n- Basic familiarity with terminal commands\n\n**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This project REQUIRES Docker. Local npm/pnpm commands are NOT supported. All development MUST use Docker containers.\n\n## Quick Start (10-15 minutes first time)\n\n### 1. Use Template on GitHub\n\nClick \"Use this template\" on [ScriptHammer](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer) and create your repository with any name you like.\n\n### 2. Clone Your New Repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-new-repo.git\ncd your-new-repo\n```\n\n### 3. Create and Configure .env File\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This step is required for Docker to run with proper permissions.\n\nFirst, check your User ID and Group ID:\n\n```bash\nid -u  # Shows your UID (often 1000)\nid -g  # Shows your GID (often 1000)\n```\n\nThen create your .env file:\n\n```bash\n# Copy the example file (contains all available options)\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nNow **EDIT the .env file** to add your configuration:\n\n```bash\n# Required for Docker - check your actual values:\n# Run: id -u  (to get your UID)\n# Run: id -g  (to get your GID)\nUID=1000  # Replace if your 'id -u' shows different\nGID=1000  # Replace if your 'id -g' shows different\n\n# Optional - Add your service credentials:\nNEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX        # Google Analytics\nNEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your-key-here    # Contact form\nNEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxx        # Email service\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDAR_URL=your-calendly-url        # Scheduling\n\n# Optional - Customize author info:\nNEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_NAME=Your Name\nNEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_GITHUB=yourusername\nNEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_TWITTER=yourhandle\n```\n\n**Note**: All these are OPTIONAL except UID/GID. The app works without them, but features like analytics and contact forms won't function until configured.\n\n### 4. Start Docker (MANDATORY - No Local Development)\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nNote: First run will take 5-10 minutes to build the Docker image and install dependencies.\n\n**⚠️ DO NOT attempt to run `npm install` or `pnpm install` locally - it WILL NOT WORK.**\n\n### 5. Access Your Project\n\nYour project is now running at `http://localhost:3000` with your repository name automatically detected!\n\nAll commands MUST be run inside Docker:\n\n```bash\n# ❌ WRONG: pnpm run dev\n# ✅ RIGHT: docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run dev\n```\n\n## What Gets Auto-Configured\n\nWhen you create from template and clone, ScriptHammer automatically detects and configures:\n\n- **Project Name**: From your repository name\n- **Owner Info**: From your GitHub username (not \"Admin\" or generic names)\n- **Author Attribution**: Your actual GitHub username appears everywhere\n- **URLs**: For deployment and links\n- **PWA Settings**: App name and manifest\n- **Build Paths**: For GitHub Pages deployment\n\n### Where to Find Your Configuration\n\nThe auto-config system generates configuration at build time:\n\n1. **TypeScript Config**: `/src/config/project-detected.ts` - Strongly typed for your components\n2. **JSON Config**: `/src/config/project-detected.json` - Raw configuration data\n\nCheck these files after running `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run build` - they contain YOUR project's information automatically detected from Git.\n\n## How to Use It\n\nThe configuration is available everywhere in your code:\n\n```typescript\n// In any component\nimport { detectedConfig } from '@/config/project-detected';\n\nexport function Header() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{detectedConfig.projectName}</h1>\n      <a href={detectedConfig.projectUrl}>View on GitHub</a>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```typescript\n// In API routes\nimport { detectedConfig } from '@/config/project-detected';\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  return Response.json({\n    project: detectedConfig.projectName,\n    owner: detectedConfig.projectOwner,\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Minimal Manual Setup\n\nTraditional templates require editing multiple files:\n\n- ❌ Update package.json with project name\n- ❌ Change configuration files in multiple locations\n- ❌ Modify deployment scripts\n- ❌ Edit PWA manifests\n- ❌ Update hardcoded references throughout codebase\n\nWith ScriptHammer:\n\n- ✅ Use template with any name\n- ✅ Create `.env` file (one-time, 30 seconds)\n- ✅ Most configuration detected automatically from git\n- ⚠️ Some components may still have hardcoded values (being improved)\n\n## Common Tasks (All Require Docker)\n\n### Deploy to GitHub Pages\n\n```bash\n# MUST use Docker - local commands won't work\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run build\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run deploy\n# Automatically configured for your repository\n```\n\n### Configure Production Environment Variables\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Your local `.env` file is NOT used in GitHub Actions. You must add your configuration as GitHub Secrets for production features to work.\n\n#### Setting Up GitHub Secrets\n\n1. **Navigate to your repository settings**:\n   - Go to your GitHub repository\n   - Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**\n   - Click **New repository secret**\n\n2. **Add your environment variables as secrets**:\n\n   Copy each value from your `.env` file and add it as a GitHub Secret with the SAME name:\n\n   ```bash\n   # All NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables in alphabetical order:\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_AVATAR           # Avatar image URL\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_BIO              # Short biography\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_BLUESKY          # Bluesky handle\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_EMAIL            # Contact email\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_GITHUB           # Your GitHub username\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_LINKEDIN         # Your LinkedIn username\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_MASTODON         # Mastodon handle (with instance)\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_NAME             # Your display name\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_ROLE             # Your professional role/title\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_TWITCH           # Twitch username\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_TWITTER          # Your Twitter/X handle\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_WEBSITE          # Your personal website\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH               # Override deployment base path\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL                # Base URL for your site\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDAR_PROVIDER        # 'calendly' or 'calcom'\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDAR_URL             # Your booking page URL\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_DISQUS_SHORTNAME        # Disqus comments for blog posts\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY       # EmailJS public key\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID       # Email service (EmailJS alternative)\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID      # Email template ID\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID        # Google Analytics tracking\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION # Google Search Console verification\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME            # Override auto-detected project name\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_OWNER           # Override auto-detected owner\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_TWITTER_HANDLE      # Site-wide Twitter handle for social cards\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL                # Custom domain (if not GitHub Pages)\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCIAL_PLATFORMS        # Comma-separated list of enabled platforms\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY     # Contact form submissions (Web3Forms)\n   ```\n\n3. **How to add a secret**:\n   - **Name**: Enter the exact variable name (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`)\n   - **Value**: Paste your key/value from `.env` (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)\n   - Click **Add secret**\n\n4. **Verify secrets are configured**:\n   - After adding, you'll see them listed (values are hidden)\n   - The deploy workflow will automatically use these during build\n   - Check your deployed site to confirm features are working\n\n#### Important Notes\n\n- **No UID/GID needed**: GitHub Actions doesn't need Docker user permissions\n- **Secrets are encrypted**: GitHub encrypts and hides secret values\n- **Build-time injection**: Secrets are injected during `pnpm run build` in CI/CD\n- **Without secrets**: Your site will deploy but features like analytics, forms, and calendars won't function\n\n#### Updating the Deploy Workflow (Optional)\n\nIf you need to use additional environment variables, update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Build Next.js app\n  run: pnpm run build\n  env:\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_AVATAR: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_AVATAR }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_BIO: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_BIO }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_BLUESKY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_BLUESKY }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_EMAIL }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_GITHUB }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_LINKEDIN: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_LINKEDIN }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_MASTODON: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_MASTODON }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_NAME: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_NAME }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_ROLE: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_ROLE }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_TWITCH: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_TWITCH }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_TWITTER: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_TWITTER }}\n    NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_WEBSITE: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_WEBSITE }}\n    # ... all other variables in alphabetical order\n```\n\n**Note**: The current workflow doesn't explicitly list env variables, but Next.js automatically reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` secrets during build if they're available in the GitHub Actions environment.\n\n### Run Tests Inside Docker\n\n```bash\n# Run the comprehensive test suite (all tests must run in Docker)\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:suite\n```\n\n**⚠️ REMINDER**: Every single command in this project MUST be prefixed with `docker compose exec scripthammer`. There are NO exceptions.\n\n### Check Current Config\n\nLook at `src/config/project-detected.ts` after running the build—it shows your detected settings.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Quick Setup**: Use template and start coding in 10-15 minutes\n- **Minimal Configuration**: Only `.env` file required, rest auto-detects\n- **Works in Most Environments**: Local Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD\n- **Reduced Errors**: Fewer manual edits means fewer mistakes\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe core detection script (`scripts/detect-project.js`) runs at build time:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getProjectInfo() {\n  // 1. Check environment variables (highest priority)\n  if (\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME &&\n    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_OWNER\n  ) {\n    return {\n      projectName: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME,\n      projectOwner: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_OWNER,\n      source: 'env',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // 2. Try git remote detection\n  const gitUrl = getGitRemoteUrl();\n  const gitInfo = parseGitUrl(gitUrl);\n  if (gitInfo) {\n    return {\n      projectName: gitInfo.repo,\n      projectOwner: gitInfo.owner,\n      source: 'git',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // 3. Fall back to defaults\n  return {\n    projectName: 'ScriptHammer',\n    projectOwner: 'TortoiseWolfe',\n    source: 'default',\n  };\n}\n```\n\nThe script (under 180 lines) handles:\n\n- Multiple git remote formats (HTTPS, SSH, various hosts)\n- CI/CD environment detection\n- Safe file writing with atomic operations\n- TypeScript and JSON generation\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Environment Detection\n\nCurrently supported:\n\n- **GitHub Actions CI** - Automatically configures for GitHub Pages\n- **Docker Development** - Consistent development environment (REQUIRED)\n- **Environment Variables** - Override auto-detection with custom values\n\n### Development vs Production\n\n```bash\n# Development - Local testing with hot reload at http://localhost:3000\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run dev\n\n# Production Build - Creates static files for GitHub Pages deployment\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run build\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run deploy\n```\n\nThe project auto-detects your configuration from git, so you don't need different settings for different environments.\n\n## Try It Now\n\n1. **Use Template** [ScriptHammer](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer) (30 seconds)\n2. **Clone** your new repository (30 seconds)\n3. **Create .env** with `cp .env.example .env` (30 seconds)\n4. **Run** `docker compose up` (5-10 minutes first build)\n5. **Check** `http://localhost:3000` - your project is ready!\n\n### What You'll See\n\n- Title bar shows YOUR project name\n- Footer links to YOUR GitHub repository\n- PWA installer shows YOUR app name\n- `/status` page displays YOUR project info\n- All configuration files have YOUR details\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Generated Files\n\nConfiguration files are generated at build time (not committed to git):\n\n- `src/config/project-detected.ts` - TypeScript configuration\n- `src/config/project-detected.json` - JSON for build scripts\n- `public/manifest.json` - PWA manifest with your project name\n- Meta tags and URLs throughout the application\n\n### Git Remote Parsing\n\nSupports multiple formats:\n\n- `https://github.com/user/repo.git`\n- `git@github.com:user/repo.git`\n- `https://gitlab.com/user/repo.git`\n- `git@bitbucket.org:user/repo.git`\n\n### Build Integration\n\n```json\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"node scripts/detect-project.js && next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"node scripts/detect-project.js && next build\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Visual Overview\n\n![Auto-Configuration Flow Diagram](/blog-images/auto-config/config-flow.svg)\n_The auto-configuration process: Use Template → Clone → Ready in 3 simple steps_\n\nThe magic happens through our detection script that runs at build time, analyzing your git remote to extract project information and automatically generating all configuration files.\n\n## Traditional Setup vs ScriptHammer\n\n![Before and After Comparison](/blog-images/auto-config/before-after.svg)\n*Save 30-60 minutes of manual configuration with every new project*\n\nWhile traditional templates require editing 22+ files and configuration points, ScriptHammer handles everything automatically. No more hunting for hardcoded values or broken references after using the template.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n**Docker permission errors:**\n\n- Make sure your `.env` file contains correct UID/GID values\n- Run `id -u` and `id -g` to get your system values\n- Ensure Docker daemon is running\n\n**Auto-detection not working:**\n\n- Verify you have a git remote: `git remote -v`\n- If no remote, add one: `git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo.git`\n- The detection reads from git remote origin URL\n\n**Project name not updating:**\n\n- Auto-detection runs at BUILD time, not runtime\n- Run `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run build` to regenerate\n- Check `src/config/project-detected.ts` for detected values\n\n**Hardcoded values still showing \"ScriptHammer\":**\n\n- Some components may still have hardcoded values\n- This is a known limitation being addressed\n- Main configuration files ARE auto-detected correctly\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nScriptHammer significantly reduces setup friction compared to traditional templates. While not completely \"zero-config,\" it automates most configuration through git detection, requiring only minimal setup (creating the `.env` file).\n\n**Minimal configuration. Quick setup. Use template and build.**\n\n---\n\n*P.S. - Check out `/scripts/detect-project.js` to see the complete auto-configuration implementation. It's a pragmatic solution that handles 90% of configuration automatically.*\n",

No \"works on my machine\" problems:\n\n```bash\n# Start development (REQUIRED - no local alternative)\ndocker compose up\n\n# ALL commands must use docker compose exec:\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run dev\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component\n\n# ❌ NEVER run locally:\n# pnpm install  # WILL NOT WORK\n# npm run dev   # WILL NOT WORK\n```\n\n## Component Generator\n\nStop copying component boilerplate. Use the generator:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component MyComponent atomic\n```\n\nThis creates the required 5-file structure:\n\n- `MyComponent.tsx` - Main component\n- `MyComponent.test.tsx` - Unit tests\n- `MyComponent.stories.tsx` - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) stories\n- `MyComponent.accessibility.test.tsx` - A11y tests\n- `index.tsx` - Barrel export\n\n## Project Configuration\n\nThe project auto-detects most configuration from your Git repository:\n\n```typescript\n// Auto-configured from git remote at build time\nconst projectConfig = {\n  name: 'YourRepoName', // Detected from repository\n  owner: 'YourGitHubUsername',\n  basePath: '/', // Configured for GitHub Pages\n  repository: 'https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName',\n};\n```\n\nMinimal setup required - just create your `.env` file and the rest is detected automatically.\n\n## Current Features in Production\n\n### Privacy & Consent\n\n- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)-compliant cookie consent system\n- Granular privacy controls\n- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) integration (with consent)\n\n### Blog System\n\n- Markdown-based blog with frontmatter\n- SEO (Search Engine Optimization) analysis and scoring\n- Table of contents generation\n- Offline-first with IndexedDB storage\n- Background sync for offline edits\n\n### Maps & Location\n\n- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) integration for interactive maps\n- Geolocation with privacy consent\n- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) tiles (no API (Application Programming Interface) key needed)\n\n### Calendar Integration\n\n- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) and [Cal.com](https://cal.com/) embedded support\n- Privacy-first with consent modal\n- Event scheduling capabilities\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── app/                # Next.js app router pages\n├── components/\n│   ├── subatomic/     # Smallest reusable pieces\n│   ├── atomic/        # Basic components\n│   ├── molecular/     # Composite components\n│   └── organisms/     # Full sections\n├── contexts/          # React contexts\n├── services/          # Business logic\n├── lib/              # Core libraries\n├── utils/            # Utility functions\n└── types/            # TypeScript definitions\n```\n\n## Testing Commands\n\n```bash\n# Quick validation\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:quick\n\n# Full test suite\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:suite\n\n# Specific tests\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run type-check\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run lint\ndocker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:coverage\n```\n\n## Why Scripthammer?\n\n1. **Quick Setup** - Create `.env`, run `docker compose up`, and you're developing\n2. **Reduced Configuration** - Opinionated choices with auto-detection from git\n3. **Production Features** - Battle-tested components and patterns\n4. **TypeScript First** - Comprehensive typing with strict mode enabled\n5. **Well Tested** - Full test suite with unit, E2E, and accessibility testing\n\n## Getting Started (Docker Required)\n\n**⚠️ PREREQUISITE**: Docker and Docker Compose MUST be installed. This project does NOT support local development.\n\n```bash\n# Use the template on GitHub first\n# Then clone YOUR new repository\ngit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-new-repo.git\ncd your-new-repo\n\n# Create required .env file (MANDATORY)\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Start Docker (ONLY way to run this project)\ndocker compose up  # First build takes 5-10 minutes\n\n# Open http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n**Remember**:\n\n- ✅ `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm install` - Correct\n- ❌ `pnpm install` - Will NOT work\n- ❌ `npm install` - Will NOT work\n\n## What's Next?\n\nCheck out the [CONSTITUTION.md](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer/blob/main/.specify/memory/constitution.md) for the project principles and current sprint goals. Read [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/TortoiseWolfe/ScriptHammer/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) for AI (Artificial Intelligence) pair programming guidelines and best practices when working with this codebase.\n\nThis is Scripthammer. Stop configuring, start shipping.\n",
